<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>Buried Alive.&mdash;The Landlord's Story.</h3>

<p>"Bravo, Oldstone! A very capital story!" cried
several members at once. "It is a pity our host isn't
here to have heard it."</p>

<p>"I heard a good part of it, though, gentlemen," said
a voice from a dark corner of the room (for the lights
had been extinguished, though it was still murky
without).</p>

<p>"What, are you there, Jack?" cried Mr. Crucible.
"We none of us saw you."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the landlord, "finding that I was
not wanted outside as I thought, I ventured to enter the
room quietly, so as not to disturb the story."</p>

<p>"Well done, Jack," said Hardcase, "and so you
heard all, eh? Well, what do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"Pretty nearly all, I guess, sir," replied the landlord,
"and a curious one it is, too, and no mistake.
But talk of being buried alive, I could tell you a queer
adventure that happened to myself, if you gentlemen
would care to hear it."</p>

<p>"Only be too glad, Jack," said Oldstone. "Out
with it; there is nothing like a good story to beguile the
time in weather like this."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Our host, thus encouraged, drew his chair close to
the fire, and his example was immediately followed by
his guests. Then, refilling his yard of clay and lighting
it in the fire, he gave one or two preliminary whiffs, and
commenced his story thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, gentlemen, when I was a youngster, that is
to say, a lad of nineteen, I fell deeply in love with my
Molly, who, though I say it, was the finest lass in the
village and for miles round it. For all the world like
my Helen, at her age, bless her dear heart! She was
the daughter of a rich miller&mdash;his only child. Well, it
had been a long attachment, for Molly and I were play-mates
when we was little, but when I grew to be about
nineteen, and my father began to see that I was head
over ears in love with Molly, he forbade me to see any
more of her, because he and old Sykes&mdash;leastways,
Molly's father, the miller&mdash;wasn't friends, d'ye see.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Molly and I used to get a peep at each
other on the sly like, and often took long walks together
when no one was near.</p>

<p>Well, old Sykes also objected to me keeping company
with his daughter, and sometimes suspecting what
was up, used to lie in wait for us, and catch us in the
lane as we was coming home from our walk. Then he'd
give us both a "blowing up," for old Sykes wasn't partickler
nice in his language, and Molly was locked up in
her room while he went to complain of me to my
father. This sort of thing occurred more than once,
and Sykes, not knowing how to put a stop to it in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
other way, sent his daughter on a visit to an aunt of hers
some distance off.</p>

<p>I didn't know nothing of this for some time, and
still went hovering round the house, expecting to see
Molly at the window. Now, there happened to be at
that time an epidemic running through the village, as
proved fatal to many, carrying off both the young and
the old, and when my father saw how pulled down I was
in health and spirits, which was all along of my not
having seen Molly for many a week, he took it into his
head that I had caught the epidemic, and sent for a
doctor. The doctor came, felt my pulse, and looked at
my tongue, and pronounced me very bad, but said that
he did not see the usual signs of the epidemic.</p>

<p>He ordered me, however, to be put to bed, and prescribed
me some physic. Instead of doing me any
good, it only made me worse, for the doctor was
ignorant of the true cause of my low spirits. I was
forced to keep in bed, and could do nothing night or
day but think of Molly. My father, seeing me rapidly
grow worse, but still ignorant of the cause&mdash;though he
knew that I had been very much cut up about Molly&mdash;began
to take on so&mdash;I being his only son&mdash;that the
doctor was afraid that he would have to take to his bed.
Once, shortly after Molly's disappearance, he told me
that she had caught the epidemic and had died.</p>

<p>He hoped by this tale to bring me to my senses,
and that I should soon forget her, and begin courting
some other girl, but it had a very different effect upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
me, and I rapidly sunk from worse to worse. When the
doctor called again, he found me in a dangerous state,
and he came to the conclusion that it must be the
epidemic after all. Whether I really had caught the
epidemic in addition to my love-sickness I can't
tell. All I know is that I felt so bad that I didn't
expect to live, and even the doctor said it was all
over with me.</p>

<p>My death was expected daily, and when one morning
the doctor came and found me stiff and cold, he gave
out to my parents that I was dead. I was no more dead
than I am at the present moment. It is true that I
could not budge an inch, and I have no doubt that I
looked thoroughly dead, but my mind was as clear and
as sharp as possible.</p>

<p>"Poor young man," I heard the doctor say. "So
hale and strong, too. Who'd have thought it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor son! my poor son!" wept my father.
"You whom I thought to rear to be the prop of my old
age, now you are torn from me for ever."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, sir," said the doctor, "else you will
make yourself ill."</p>

<p>"How can I calm myself?" cried my father, in
agony. "Was he not my <i>only</i> son? and I&mdash;I&mdash;fool,
wretch, that I was&mdash;<i>I</i> killed him!"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> killed him!" cried the doctor. "How?
Surely you rave, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes," persisted my father; "the poor boy was in
love with a maid whose father is my enemy. I objected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to his marrying her, as did also the girl's father, who
wishing to save his daughter from my son sent her away
to live at the house of an aunt in the village of H&mdash;&mdash; in &mdash;&mdash;shire.
As my son knew nothing of this, I told
him, thinking to make him forget her, that the maid
was dead, but the poor boy took on so dreadful about
it, that it has been his death, and I&mdash;yes I am his
murderer!" and I thought his sobs would choke him.</p>

<p>"It was very wrong and foolish of you," said the
doctor, "to tell him so, when you saw him so weak and
ailing, yet you did it with a good intent, and I do not see
that you can justly accuse yourself of being his murderer."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," sobbed my father, bitterly, "I have
killed him&mdash;my son, my <i>only</i> son!"</p>

<p>Now I had discovered a secret. Molly was not dead,
but living at her aunt's. I knew her address; if I could
but be restored to life, I might see her once again. I
longed to be able to call out: "Father, I am not dead&mdash;comfort
yourself," but my tongue refused utterance. I
tried to move my limbs, and did all that was in my
power to show signs of life, but I still lay powerless&mdash;paralysed,
for I was in a trance. Oh! the agony I
suffered! How long would it last? Should I be really
nailed up in a coffin and buried alive? Oh, horror!</p>

<p>Some of my friends the neighbours were called in
to see me and mourned over my corpse.</p>

<p>"Poor Jack!" one of them said; "if lads of his
kidney are not proof against the epidemic, who may
hope to escape?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day an undertaker was sent for to measure
me for my coffin.</p>

<p>"Where will all this end?" thought I. "Shall I
awake before the coffin is made?"</p>

<p>This was my only hope; but if not, all was lost.
Once nailed down, nailed down for ever. The thought
was agony.</p>

<p>Here I was, struck down in the flower of my youth,
to all appearances dead, yet with my mind keenly alive
to all that was going on around me. Oh, that I could
become insensible! I knew not how long this dreadful
trance would last; all I knew was that if it lasted more
than a day or two longer it would be all up with me.
I was laid out in state, and all that day and the next
friends poured in to gaze upon my corpse.</p>

<p>As the time grew nearer for my funeral the more
despairing I got. At length the coffin arrived. I
shuddered. Had my last moment actually come?
What could I do? Nothing.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven!" I cried within myself, "for what fell
crime am I doomed to bear this agony of soul?"</p>

<p>Two undertakers now lifted me from my bed, one
of them seizing me by the shoulders, the other by the
feet, and I felt myself placed within a leaden coffin
supported upon trestles. I did my utmost now to make
one last desperate effort to rouse myself out of my
trance, but in vain.</p>

<p>"Oh, if they should nail me up!" I thought.</p>

<p>Then I was left alone all day, and remember a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
bustle and whispering going on in the house. All were
talking of my funeral. At length the fatal hour arrived!
The undertakers entered my room again. Good
Heavens! they were actually going to solder me down.
The next instant the leaden lid was down upon me,
and I was soon tightly secured. Then commenced
the knocking in of the nails of the outer coffin. How
painfully distinct was the sound of the hammer! I
remember counting each nail as it was driven in. At
length the task was completed, and I only awaited the
hearse to carry me to my last home.</p>

<p>Then there was more bustle, the meeting of friends,
etc., when after waiting a little longer, I heard the footsteps
of the bearers. I felt myself lifted upon the
shoulders of the men and carried downstairs. A crowd
had evidently collected round the door, for I heard the
muffled sound of voices gossipping, but could not distinguish
what they said. Only the tolling of the church
bell jarred upon my ears. Then the procession began.
How slowly it moved along!</p>

<p>"Oh! if I could even now awake!" thought I, "it
might not be too late. If I could make sufficient
movement with my limbs to overturn the coffin, or even
had strength to call out, I should even now be saved."</p>

<p>But all in vain&mdash;rigid, motionless as ever, in spite of
my earnest prayers to be restored to life. I felt myself
borne leisurely on&mdash;whither? Oh, horror! to the cold
and narrow grave&mdash;to the abode of the dead. My last
hope died within me when I felt the procession stop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and I knew that it was already arrived at the cemetery.
I remember hearing faintly the tones of the parson's
voice as he read the ceremony for the burial of the
dead. The coffin was now lowered into the grave, and
I heard with awful distinctness the words "earth to
earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust," followed by the
rattling of the three handfuls of earth upon my coffin
lid. My last hope was now gone. In another moment
I should be covered up with mould and left alone to
die miserably.</p>

<p>"Oh!" groaned I, in spirit, "it is all over with
me!" as I heard the mould tumbling heavily upon me.</p>

<p>I knew that the grave was now covered up, for the
voices of my friends were quite inaudible, and all was
silent.</p>

<p>What a terrible feeling of isolation was mine! Cut
off completely from the rest of the world by some feet of
earth, alive, yet supposed to be dead, deserted by friends
and doomed at length to awaken only to suffer a death
of all deaths most horrible! Had I still believed Molly
to be dead, it would have been some consolation to me
to die; nay, how gladly would I have welcomed death
that I might meet her in a better land. But, alas, I knew
that Molly still lived, and after death I should be
further away from her than ever. This thought was
agony to me. One thing, however, somewhat consoled
me, though it was but poor consolation.</p>

<p>"We must all die," I thought.</p>

<p>Molly must die, too. It might be years before she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
left this earth, still I should see her again sooner or
later. But then came another, thought which, do all I
could, I was unable to banish from my mind. In the
meantime Molly might marry someone else, and rear up
a large family of children, and what could I be to her
then if I ever chanced to meet her in the other world?
If ever human soul knew agony, mine knew it then. I
longed for no eternity without Molly, and I remember
praying that my spirit might be utterly annihilated and
become as insensible as the clay that I was about to
leave behind me. It was a dreadful and an impious
prayer, but when during life, one dear idol has monopolised
the heart and there reigns supreme, even the fear
of eternal damnation is insufficient to drive it from its
throne.</p>

<p>"Oh, that I could die quickly and be at rest for
ever!"</p>

<p>Then I prayed fervently a long, heartfelt, earnest
prayer, after which I felt more calm, more resigned to
my fate. I had no hopes of being rescued and being
brought back to life&mdash;that hope had quite left me. I
now only wished for a speedy and peaceful death.
Many weary hours I lay on my back within my narrow
prison&mdash;rigid&mdash;immovable&mdash;a living soul amongst the
dead. The silence that reigned around was intense,
almost inconceivable to those accustomed to the busy
world without.</p>

<p>I missed the rustling of the leaves, the chirping of
the birds, the distant lowing of cattle, the hum of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
voices, every sound of life; all was still, for it was <i>the
silence of the grave</i>. The only sound at all audible, and
that was so indistinct and muffled from the pile of earth
that covered me that, had my sense of hearing not been
excited to an abnormal pitch, I should not have heard
it, and that was the sound of the church clock as it
struck the hour. I had been buried in the morning at
about ten o'clock, and I remember counting the hours
until ten o'clock at night. Every hour appeared to me
a century, until, exhausted with the agony of mind I had
endured, I fell asleep and dreamed of Molly. I thought
that I was by her side walking under the trees in a part
of the country that I had never seen before.</p>

<p>There was a house at some distance, which she said
belonged to her aunt. I was telling her all about how
I came to be buried alive, and she was listening to me
and looking up in my face with tearful eyes, for she had
heard that I was dead. I also dreamed that I saw a
serpent moving in the grass at her feet. I sprang up
and beat it severely with my cane. At first it attempted
to defend itself, but at length it escaped from me
severely bruised.</p>

<p>The dream then changed from one subject to
another, but Molly was by my side throughout. It was
exceedingly vivid, and I doubted not at the time but
that I was by her side in reality.</p>

<p>I know not how long I had been asleep when I
heard a confused noise while still in a dreaming state,
and I awoke to find myself once more in my coffin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, why was not this dream allowed to last?" I
groaned to myself, and tried to fall asleep again, hoping
to take up the thread of my dream at the point that I
had lost it, but in vain, for now I heard the same noise
in reality over my head. It was the sound of men's
voices. Who could they be? Was I still dreaming?
No!</p>

<p>They were the resurrectionists, or the "body-snatchers,"
as we generally call them. They had come
to rob my body in order to sell it to some doctor.
How my heart beat for joy!</p>

<p>"I shall be saved! I shall be saved!" said I to
myself.</p>

<p>"O merciful God!" I prayed in spirit, "who
scornest not to make the meanest of thy creatures thine
instruments, I thank Thee for having heard my prayers
and delivered me from this fearful death. I am
unworthy of all thy mercies, O God! Perform thy
miracles on men more worthy."</p>

<p>The body-snatchers had now shovelled all the earth
away that covered me, and they began to lift the coffin
out of the grave. Had it been my friend's coffin instead
of my own, I should have stigmatised the men
who attempted to disinter his body as thieves, robbers,
a set of midnight marauders; but in the present instance
I blessed them as my deliverers, as my brothers. My
heart yearned towards them, for my hopes began to
revive.</p>

<p>It would be discovered that I was not dead, at least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
I hoped so, and when my trance should pass off I should
be able to find some way of seeing Molly again. The
next moment the outer coffin was wrenched open; then
they proceeded to force the leaden one. This was soon
done, and I now felt the chill night air. To lift me out,
thrust me headfirst into a sack, and shovel the earth
into the grave again, was the work of a moment, and I
now felt myself laid across the shoulder of one of the
men, and carried off.</p>

<p>"Where was I bound for?" I asked myself.</p>

<p>The men began talking together, so I resolved to
listen&mdash;to learn, if possible, what they were going to do
with me.</p>

<p>"A fine corpse, Bill," said one body-snatcher to the
other.</p>

<p>"Aye, my word," replied Bill, "but what a weight
he be!"</p>

<p>"Ah! I dare say; these youngsters are so full of
blood and muscle," said the other.</p>

<p>"Tell you what it is, Tom," said my bearer, "you
must lend me a hand or I shall never bring him safely
to the doctor's to-night. Here, just take him on your
shoulders a bit!"</p>

<p>I then felt myself transferred from the shoulders of
Bill to those of Tom.</p>

<p>"Begad! you're right," said the latter. "He be a
load, sure<i>ly</i>."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bill, "the doctor has got the full
worth of his money, and no mistake. For less than ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
guineas I wouldn't have undertaken the task on such a
night as this. Hark! how the wind howls. My teeth
chatter in spite of myself. Poor Jack! Many's the
good draught of malt he has drawn for me in his father's
tap-room!"</p>

<p>"Peace, you fool!" cried Tom; "don't talk so loud,
or the thing will get wind in the village, and we shall get
torn to pieces. Hush! there is someone behind the
hedge."</p>

<p>Then they walked on in silence for some time, and
on the way I was once more hoisted on to the
shoulders of Bill.</p>

<p>"Oh, you beggar, what a weight you be!" said Bill,
addressing me. "Well, we're paid for it, so I suppose
I must carry you," and off we trudged again.</p>

<p>"This is the way to Dr. Slasher's house," said Tom.
"I see a light in the windows; he is awaiting us."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bill, "we've been pretty punctual. It
is not much past twelve o'clock. Here we are at last."</p>

<p>The two men stopped, and one threw some earth
against the doctor's window. The next moment I heard
footsteps within, and the door was opened noiselessly.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the doctor's voice.</p>

<p>The two men entered the house, when I was
taken out of my sack and deposited upon a table in
the doctor's study. It was the same doctor who had
attended me during my illness.</p>

<p>"Fine specimen, sir," said Bill, "and tough work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
enough we've had to get him, neither; the ground's as
hard as a brick-bat."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the doctor, abstractedly, feeling me all
over.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the other; "and how heavy he be
too!"</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the doctor.</p>

<p>"It is a bitter cold night," said Bill. "The wind
howled among the trees while we was at work enough to
make one's blood curdle."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said the doctor; "I know what that means.
A glass of grog wouldn't be unacceptable, unless I
mistake."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, you've just guessed about right," said
Bill. "A glass of grog now and then, just to keep out
the cold is a very fine thing, as you, being a doctor, sir,
I've no doubt are well aware."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed the doctor. "I perceive you
understand the theory of the circulation of the blood.
Well, as you have done your work well, I'll just put
the kettle on the hob, and you shall have a good stiff
glass apiece."</p>

<p>"That's the sort of thing, eh, Tom? The doctor is
a real gentleman, and no mistake."</p>

<p>Tom acquiesced, and soon the doctor produced a
tall bottle of brandy, and more than half filling two
tumblers, and popping a couple of lumps of sugar into
each glass, he lifted the kettle from the hob and filled
them up to the brim. Then, stirring up the sugar at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the bottom with the handle of his dissecting knife, he
handed a glass to each of his creatures across my body.</p>

<p>"Here's luck, sir," said one of them, nodding.</p>

<p>"I looks towards you, sir," said the other, sipping
his grog.</p>

<p>"Thanks, my man, thanks," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;&mdash;h!" gasped Bill, after a deep draught, and
smacking his lips, "this is something like a glass of
grog. I feel myself again. I'd as lief set out again
after another subject to-night as not."</p>

<p>"Well, mate," said Tom, draining his glass, "I guess
we'd better toddle."</p>

<p>The doctor then counted out twenty guineas, and
gave the men ten apiece.</p>

<p>"Thank ye kindly, sir," said they, "and when again
you be in want of our services, your honour knows
where to find us. Good-night, sir."</p>

<p>"Good-night," responded the doctor, as he showed
them out and closed the door.</p>

<p>I was left alone for a moment, but when he returned
he might begin dissecting me at once, and that would
be horrible, for I was still in my trance. I hoped he
would defer operations until the morrow. In the meantime
I hoped to come to. Then I heard the doctor's
footsteps in the passage, and here he was again. Would
he really cut me up before I could call out or defend
myself? Good Heavens! What was he about now?
He had tucked up his shirt sleeves and seized his
dissecting-knife!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>All was lost. My hopes had been raised only to be
dashed to the ground. My last hour had come. Already
I felt the point of the murderous instrument against my
chest. Rip!&mdash;an incision had been made!</p>

<p>"Hullo!" cried the doctor, dropping his dissecting-knife.
"What is this? Why the man's not dead!"</p>

<p>The fact was, I was gradually recovering, and my
blood had already begun to flow. The intense mental
agony I had endured had caused a cold sweat to break
out on my forehead. The incision luckily was not very
deep, but I bear the mark of the wound to this day.</p>

<p>The doctor staunched the blood with his handkerchief,
muttering to himself, "And have I been obliged
to pay twenty guineas for a living subject? Humph!
I've a good mind to cut him up all the same, no one
would be any the wiser for it."</p>

<p>I began to fear lest he might do so in real earnest;
however, he bound up my wound and carried me into
his own bedroom, where he placed me on a mattress
on the ground. He wiped the perspiration from my
forehead and felt my pulse.</p>

<p>"He'll come round," he muttered to himself;
"already he shows signs of life. I would not for the
world, though, that this got known in the village. I
should lose all my practice, and yet I don't know how
to keep the matter quiet, it <i>must</i> ooze out."</p>

<p>Life was rapidly returning. I began to open and
shut my eyes and to breathe, though with some difficulty.
By degrees, however, I managed to breathe more freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" said the doctor, noticing the rapid change,
"getting all right, now&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>I remained in the same state for about an hour
more, when the doctor began undressing and preparing
to turn in for the night. In another moment he was
between the sheets and snoring loudly. Soon after I fell
asleep myself.</p>

<p>The following morning on awaking, I felt almost
myself again. I could move my limbs and sit up in
bed, though I still felt very weak.</p>

<p>"Well, how are we now?" asked the doctor, seeing
that I moved with comparative ease. "A nice trick
you've played me. Do you know that you have done
me out of twenty guineas&mdash;by coming to life again&mdash;eh?
I hoped to have cut you all up by this time&mdash;and
I might have done so, too, easily enough at the
time, but I suppose if I were to try it on now you'd
halloa."</p>

<p>Then he began to ask me all sorts of questions, to
which I answered feebly. In reply to a question of his
as to whether I felt hungry, I nodded my head, and the
doctor went to prepare me a cup of broth. When he
returned and I had partaken of it, new strength came
back to me, and I was able to relate to him all my
sufferings while he listened attentively. Well, day after
day I improved in health under the doctor's care, till I
at length completely recovered. One morning after I
was up and dressed, and breakfasting with the doctor
(N.B.&mdash;Nobody, not even the doctor's servant, knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
anything about either the removal of my body from the
grave or of my coming to life again, for the doctor took
good care to keep me locked up for a time in his bedchamber.)
Well, breakfasting one morning with the
doctor, I noticed that he looked rather thoughtful and
confused.</p>

<p>"Now, I'll tell you what your thoughts are, doctor,"
said I, "and you see if I haven't guessed right."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, somewhat surlily.</p>

<p>"You are afraid that the affair about digging up my
body may get known, and will damage your reputation,
and you do not know how to keep it secret. Is it
not so?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said he, "you've just guessed about
right, but what is to be done?"</p>

<p>"Listen to me," said I. "I have a plan."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said he, opening his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, a plan to kill two birds with one stone," I said.
"It is to your interest that this affair should not be
known&mdash;eh? Well, it is to my interest, too. All will
go well if you do as I propose."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked he, with eagerness.</p>

<p>"First you must lend me a complete disguise, consisting
of one of your old wigs, a pair of tortoiseshell
spectacles, and one of your suits of clothes. Secondly,
you must lend me a certain sum of money to keep me
for, say, a fortnight. I'll pay you back in due time,
when my plan has succeeded. You needn't be afraid.
You can trust Jack Hearty&mdash;eh?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," said he, with some hesitation.
"But how? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," said I; "you will know all in
good time."</p>

<p>"Well, Jack," said he, "I know you for a sharp
fellow and an honest&mdash;so I will trust you. I don't
know what your scheme is; but if it fail, and the worst
comes to the worst, why I can but be exposed, and
there is an end of it."</p>

<p>"Well said, doctor," said I; "now let us commence
to put the scheme into practice."</p>

<p>He then took from his wardrobe rather a threadbare
suit of black clothes, which I immediately donned.
Then I tried on an old powdered wig with a pigtail and
a pair of lace ruffles, next a pair of tortoiseshell spectacles
with glasses as big as a crown piece. I next
corked my eyebrows, slightly stained the tip of my nose
with red and made a few false wrinkles in my forehead.
The doctor placed a gold-headed cane in my hand and
a large signet ring on my forefinger. I then took a
book under my arm, and at parting the doctor gave me
a purse of gold to put in my pocket, and off I started.
The doctor laughed immoderately at my successful disguise,
and I heard him say as I was leaving the house,
"I don't know what he means to be up to, but some
devilry, <i>I'll</i> lay a farthing."</p>

<p>Well, gentlemen, the next thing I did was to walk
straight off to catch the stage, which would pass by the
village of H&mdash;&mdash;, where Molly was staying with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
aunt. I remember I had to run for it, and pretty hard,
too, but I caught it up. Tearing along as fast as my
legs could carry me, I passed by a group of villagers,
some of my friends amongst them, and I heard the
following remarks:</p>

<p>"Here comes the doctor, running for his life!"&mdash;"Go
it doctor, you'll catch it up!"&mdash;"My eyes, don't
he run!&mdash;who'd have thought the old boy had so much
life in him?"</p>

<p>"It ain't the doctor, though; it's another man. I
don't know him, Jim, do you? I wonder how long he
has been in the village. I never see him before."</p>

<p>As I was stepping into the coach I heard a voice
behind me say, "I thought it was Dr. Slasher, Bill,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at first," said another; "he's like him&mdash;leastways
the clothes is."</p>

<p>"By the way," said the first, "I wonder when the
doctor will be ready for another subject. I suppose
poor Jack's cut up long since."</p>

<p>"Hush! you fool," said the other.</p>

<p>By this time I had taken my seat in the coach, and
looking in the direction of the voices, I recognised my
friends of the other night, Tom and Bill. Off we then
started. The coach was full of men I knew as well as
my own father, most of them my customers. I
appeared absorbed in my book, so as not to get
entangled in conversation with anyone, for fear that my
voice might betray me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Two men, who appeared to be strangers to each
other, began entering into conversation.</p>

<p>"Dreadful business this epidemic, sir," said the
younger of the two to the elder.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is indeed," replied the elder; "the young
fare the same as the old, they say, but I am a stranger
in the place."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed, sir," said the first speaker; and then
added, "Yes, sir&mdash;that's true enough&mdash;the young die as
soon as the old. Hardly a week ago died young Jack
Hearty, son of old Hearty, as keeps the Headless Lady&mdash;a
lad of nineteen, and as hale a young fellow as ever
you'd find in a day's march. He was taken suddenly
ill, and died in a very few days.</p>

<p>"Poor young fellow! who'd have thought that he
would have gone along with the rest? He was an only
son, too, and they say his father is devilish down in the
mouth about it."</p>

<p>"Dear me! dreadful, to be sure," replied the elder.</p>

<p>The conversation then changed to various topics,
and became general, the only one not joining in it being
myself. I still pored over my book, appearing not to
take an interest in anything that was being said, although
my ears were open to catch every word.</p>

<p>"Who's that cove?" I heard one say to his
neighbour.</p>

<p>"Oi doan't knaw, Oi'm sure," replied the one addressed,
being a lusty farmer. "Oi never see'd un in these parts
afore&mdash;looks loike a doctor."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't he speak?" said the other. "He won't
talk to no one."</p>

<p>"Maybe un's too proud," said the former.</p>

<p>"I'd like to kick the surly devil," said his companion.</p>

<p>"What'll you bet Oi doan't make un speak?" said
the countryman.</p>

<p>"Bet you a halfpenny you don't get a word out of
him," said the first speaker.</p>

<p>"Done," said the farmer, and turning suddenly
upon me, accosted me thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oi zay, governor, you bes a doctor, b'aint ye?"</p>

<p>I drew myself up with an air of dignity, and said
with a frown, and in a feigned voice: "Did you address
<i>me</i>, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ees," said the bumpkin, unawed by my assumption
of dignity; "and Oi axes ye if ye b'aint a doctor."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," I said; "and if I am!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" he laughed coarsely. "Oi
knowed ye was. Oi thought Oi knowed the breed.
Vell, you doctors has made a pretty harvest of late, Oi
reckon," said the farmer, bluntly.</p>

<p>"How so, sir," I asked. "I do not understand you."</p>

<p>"Vhy, vith the patients as has died in this here
hepidemic," said he. "They must have brought grist
to your mill, if Oi'm not mistook."</p>

<p>"What epidemic?" I asked, feigning surprise. "I
am a stranger in these parts, and know nothing of the
epidemic."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Vhy, ye doan't mane to zay that ye never heard of
th' epidemic as all th' vorld is a talking of," said he.</p>

<p>"All the world!" I cried, in astonishment. "All
your little village, I suppose you mean&mdash;no, I am entirely
ignorant of this malady."</p>

<p>"Vell then, doctor," said the boor, "if ye'd only set
up in our village, there's a snug little business going on
for the loikes of you."</p>

<p>"Humph!" I grunted, not deigning to make other
reply.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, sir," said a man in the opposite corner
of the coach, joining in the conversation, but more respectfully
than my friend the farmer. "I assure you
that a doctor's services are very much needed in these
parts. They say the malady is spreading."</p>

<p>The last speaker was a man I knew as well as I
know my own face in a looking-glass, and whom I had
served to innumerable pints of our home-brewed ale&mdash;a
crony of mine, in fact, yet he failed to see through my
disguise.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said I. "I hope it will be nothing
very serious. I regret not being able to make myself
useful, as I have several important cases to attend to a
long distance off."</p>

<p>"Oh, it has been very bad indeed, sir, hereabouts,"
said the same man. "Most cases have been fatal. The
death that has been most talked of in the village
is that of poor Jack Hearty, a lad of nineteen, as
strong and as good looking a young fellow as any in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
village. He was took bad, as it might be, yesterday, and
struck down to-day in the very flower of his youth."</p>

<p>"You don't say so?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he resumed; "and I'll be bound to say
you wouldn't find a finer young fellow in all England."</p>

<p>"Really!" said I, inwardly feeling flattered.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said another, with a sly wink. "I think I
could tell you what hastened Jack's death as much as
anything."</p>

<p>"What was that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"There was a young woman in the case, they say,"
said the man, whom I also knew intimately.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said I, with a well-feigned innocence;
"and this young woman&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Well, I believe he died pining for her, and folks
say as how it was the hepidemic."</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said with a sigh. "That is an epidemic
we all catch some time or other, but most folks get over
it, I fancy."</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said the man; "most folks, as you say,
do, but poor Jack was very hard hit indeed, sir. I
happen to know the young woman, too&mdash;as fine a wench
as you'll meet with in the whole kingdom."</p>

<p>"Ah! indeed," I said. "They would have been well
matched then, had they married?"</p>

<p>"They would indeed, sir," was the reply. "They'd
have made a pair as you wouldn't meet every day.
Well, well," he sighed; "he's gone now, poor fellow,
so the wench must look out for someone else."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did the girl take it much to heart, think you?"
said I.</p>

<p>"Aye, I'll warrant she did, sir," said he, "though I
can't say for certain, seeing as how her father sent her
away from home to get her out of Jack's way. But
she'll have heard all about it by this time. Poor girl!
I am sorry for her. She'll have to wait a long time
before she finds another like Jack."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she may never marry," I suggested; "that
is if she really loved him."</p>

<p>"Can't say I'm sure, sir. You see the maid is
quite young yet, and has got lots of admirers; what
with one and what with another, she may in time forget
Jack and take to someone else," said my friend.</p>

<p>"You have heard no rumours as yet, I suppose, of
her showing any partiality towards anyone," I demanded,
timidly.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I can't say that exactly, but then it is
so shortly after Jack's death, that it isn't likely she
would just yet. Still there's a young fellow, the son of a
squire, as is very sweet upon her, and is always
following of her about. If she could manage to catch
him, she'd do well, but the young gent's father don't
approve of it, and is like to cut him off to a shilling if
he marries her. Folks say that the young squire is a
bit of a scamp, and don't mean marriage. It'll be a
pity if the maid goes wrong, for she is a good girl, and
no mistake."</p>

<p>Now this was gall and wormwood to me. I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
that that rascal young Rashly had been hovering about
Molly's house for some time. He had often crossed
me in my walks with Molly, and we hated each other
like poison, but I also knew that Molly couldn't bear
the sight of him, for she was really and truly in love
with me, yet the very mention of his name coupled with
hers made my blood boil. Mastering my emotion,
however, I asked with as much apparent indifference as
possible, "And this young gentleman, where is he
now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, up to his larks, I'll warrant," said the man,
with a laugh. "The girl's father has sent her away to
live with her aunt, to get her out of Jack's way, as he is
not friends with Jack's father, and I guess out of the
way of the young squire, too; but young Rashly has
been absent now some time from the village, and I'll be
bound he has found her out by this time. Now that
poor Jack's dead he'll have the way all clear before him."</p>

<p>"The devil take him," I muttered to myself. I
was bursting with rage, and to conceal my emotion, I
affected to stare out of the window at some object,
while my heart beat underneath my borrowed waistcoat,
and must have been audible but for the coach wheels.
I appeared again absorbed in my book while the rest of
the passengers discoursed upon general topics.</p>

<p>"Give us the halfpenny," I heard my bluff fellow-traveller
say to his friend; "it's been fairly von." His
friend's hand was buried for an instant, and the coin
was transferred from his to the farmer's breeches pocket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's zum business, onyrate," said the countryman,
receiving the payment of the bet with a chuckle.</p>

<p>The stage then rolled on for some distance further,
till some passenger called out:</p>

<p>"There is H&mdash;&mdash;, any passenger for H&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said I; "I am for H&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>The stage stopped, and with trembling hands and
beating heart I squeezed past the other passengers.</p>

<p>"Good morning, gentlemen," said I, as I walked off.</p>

<p>The stage was set in motion again. There was no
other passenger but myself for the village of H&mdash;&mdash;, so
I strolled off with light step to the nearest inn.</p>

<p>Having refreshed myself with a light luncheon, I
strolled about the country a bit until I came across&mdash;you
may be surprised, gentlemen&mdash;but I actually came
across the very same house with the very identical
country round about it, including the wood, that
appeared in my dream. I certainly <i>was</i> startled.</p>

<p>"Yonder, then, is the house of Molly's aunt," I
thought, and I walked towards it, thinking all the while
how I should introduce myself.</p>

<p>Before I reached the house, however, two figures in
the distance under the trees of the wood attracted my
gaze. I looked again. One of the figures, I was sure,
could be no other than Molly herself, and the other I
was equally certain was young Rashly.</p>

<p>I hastened my steps, but by a route so as not to
come directly in front of them, for I wished to overhear
their conversation. Having made a roundabout cut, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
concealed myself behind some brushwood, where I
could both see them distinctly, and hear all they said
without being seen by them.</p>

<p>"Come, Molly," I heard young Rashly say,
"enough of this. What is the good of making yourself
miserable about young Hearty? He's dead now, poor
fellow&mdash;he was a great friend of mine, but now that he
is gone and can never come back to you, try to forget
him. I wish to console you and to raise your spirits.
Now, my dear girl, do try and forget him."</p>

<p>"Oh, never, never!" sobbed Molly, "I never <i>can</i>
forget him. I shall never be able to love anyone else.
Poor fellow! He died out of love for me, I know he
did. Oh, Jack, Jack, I never can forget you&mdash;never,
never!" and she sobbed as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>"Now, Molly, this is nothing but obstinacy; you
can't call him back, however you may mourn for him.
Just look at the position <i>I</i> offer you. <i>I</i> shall be able to
make you more comfortable than Jack would have been
able to make you. Is it nothing to be made a lady of?
Don't be a fool, girl, and throw such a chance away.
Hundreds in your place would jump at it."</p>

<p>"How can I accept such terms from a man I do
not love?" cried Molly. "Would I not be one of the
basest of women to persuade you that I loved you just
to become your wife, when my heart is another's?"</p>

<p>"How can your heart be another's when Jack is no
more?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; in death my heart shall still be his,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Molly cried.</p>

<p>"Come, now, you're talking like a mad
girl. Just listen to reason a bit. I will settle a good
round sum a year upon you to keep you as a lady in a
nice little cottage with a garden, where I shall always be
able to come to pay you a visit in secret, when my
father is out of the way."</p>

<p>"Then you never from the first intended to <i>marry</i>
me," interrupted Molly, "you only&mdash;only&mdash;wanted
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, actually <i>marry</i> you, no; I never intended
that. <i>That</i> would be impossible, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly; I understand you," answered Molly,
proudly, "but I scorn your base proposals. If you
were to lay the wealth of the universe at my feet, I
would never barter my good name. So <i>this</i> is what
you have been trying at all this time, to make me your
minion.</p>

<p>"When first you visited me, you gave me to understand
that your intentions were honourable, and though
I loved you not, and never could, yet I respected you
and felt compassion for you and tried to think of you as
a friend. Now I neither pity nor respect you, but <i>despise</i>
you. Go, sir, and never dare to speak to me again!"</p>

<p>"What a trump of a girl!" I muttered to myself.</p>

<p>"Molly! Molly!" cried Rashly, starting backward
in amazement, "are you mad?"</p>

<p>"I should be mad to accept your proposals," replied
Molly, calmly, but firmly. "Go, sir&mdash;all friendship
between us is at an end."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear Molly," began Rashly, "I beg of you, I
entreat you to calm yourself&mdash;to take a more reasonable
view of the matter. Come, let me persuade you, dear,"
said he, advancing and attempting to put his arm round
her waist, but he was instantly repulsed.</p>

<p>He essayed again.</p>

<p>"Dare to touch me once more, sir, and I'll scream&mdash;I'll
rouse the neighbourhood and expose you."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush!" said Rashly, nothing daunted,
"be reasonable, there's a good girl, I'll do you no
harm," and he ventured to touch her again.</p>

<p>"Back, sir, I say!" and she lifted up her voice to
scream, but instantly his hand was on her mouth.</p>

<p>I could endure it no longer, but bursting from my
hiding-place, and grasping firmly my gold-headed cane,
I sprang to the spot.</p>

<p>"Who are you, sir?" I cried, boiling with rage,
"that dare offer to insult my niece? Begone! or it
will be the worse for you."</p>

<p>Both started, and Rashly turned livid and trembled.</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir," said Molly, "for interfering."</p>

<p>Then thrusting Rashly aside, I cried; "Molly!
I am your uncle, do you not know me?" trying
to disguise my voice all the while, which was rather
a difficult matter, boiling with passion as I was
then.</p>

<p>"I do not know you, sir, though I believe your
intentions to be good," said Molly.</p>

<p>Then seizing Molly by the hand, I whispered in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
ear; "Silence!&mdash;not a word&mdash;I am Jack risen from the
grave."</p>

<p>A piercing shriek, and Molly fell fainting against a
tree.</p>

<p>"Who are you, you vagabond?" cried Rashly, now
for the first time recovering from his surprise. "She
does not know you. What have you been saying to the
poor girl to frighten her so? You are an impostor, sir.
Be off and mind your own business!"</p>

<p>"Impostor! eh?&mdash;vagabond, eh? I'll show you
who is a vagabond, you scoundrel!" said I, and lifting
my cane, I laid it about him with all my might and
main like a cavalryman cutting down his foe.</p>

<p>Rashly at first attempted to defend himself, and flew
at me like a tiger; he tried to snatch the cane from my
hand, but I hit him so severely across the knuckles that
I made him howl out in spite of himself. I cut him
right and left over head, shoulders, arms and legs, hacking
and slashing with the force of an infuriated madman,
accompanying each blow with such epithets as
"scoundrel," "blackguard," till he burst out in a piteous
cry and took refuge in flight. He never troubled
Molly again.</p>

<p>The doctor's gold-headed cane had been broken
with the force of the blows I had dealt my rival, for
which afterwards I had to pay, but to return to Molly.
She gradually recovered her senses, and gazed at me
wonderingly and full of fear.</p>

<p>"Be calm, Molly," I said in my natural voice, "it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
I&mdash;Jack, risen from the grave, but still in the flesh and
no spirit." Then taking off my spectacles and wig, I
said, "Molly, do you not recognise these eyes and these
locks, in spite of the rest of my disguise?"</p>

<p>She still looked fearful and distrustingly at me, but
at length convinced that it was myself&mdash;and no one else&mdash;by
my voice, she flew to my arms crying, "Oh, Jack,
Jack!&mdash;is it really you?"</p>

<p>Of course, she wanted an instant explanation of my
resurrection, which I by degrees gave; and having given
it, I began to unfold to her my plan, thus.</p>

<p>"Molly," I said, "what I have told you and am
about to tell you now must remain a secret between ourselves,
otherwise my plan will fail. Well then, in the
first place you must get me acquainted with your aunt,
and give out that I am an elderly gentleman you have
known some time, and that you have met me quite unexpectedly
here. You must invite me to call at the
house. I shall adopt the name of Dr. Crow. You
must feign illness and send for me. Thus we shall be
able to see a good deal of each other. I will also persuade
your aunt that she is ill, so that we shall see still
more of each other. I'll worm myself into her good graces
and after about a fortnight or so, I shall ask your
aunt's consent to our marriage. I shall tell her that I
am a doctor in good practice, and shall be able to
keep you well, and when I once get the right side of
her, I doubt not that I shall obtain her consent. She
will then write to your father, who will hardly say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
anything against a match so advantageous, although our
ages may be apparently unequal.</p>

<p>"It is not likely that he will trouble himself to come
down here to have a look at me, as he is at present laid
up with the gout. He will in all probability write his
consent. That once obtained, I shall make all necessary
preparations for the marriage, and as for obtaining my
father's consent&mdash;leave that to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Jack! if your plan should fail&mdash;if your disguise
should be seen through," began Molly.</p>

<p>"Leave all to me," said I. "So far I have been successful,
for I have not been recognised yet. Fortune
seems on my side. You must aid me in every possible
way to carry out my plan."</p>

<p>"I will, Jack!" said she.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said I, "you must go home now to
your aunt, and say you have met an old friend of yours
quite by chance here&mdash;a certain Dr. Crow. Say also
that I should like to call and make her acquaintance.
Meet me again to-morrow in the wood, and invite me
to the house. In time, I've no doubt, all will go well."</p>

<p>Molly promised to follow my instructions, and we
parted.</p>

<p>It was then late in the afternoon, so I returned to my
inn. There I found a snug little parlour, with a bookcase,
so I beguiled the time as well as I could by reading
until the clock struck the dinner hour. After a comfortable
meal, I smoked a pipe of tobacco, strolled about
the streets a little in the twilight, and turned into bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning, after breakfast, I strolled out again
into the wood. I walked about for an hour, perhaps,
without meeting anyone, casting anxious glances all the
while towards the house where Molly lived.</p>

<p>At length she made her appearance; not alone this
time, but with another female. This must be the
aunt, I thought&mdash;so much the better. Feeling the
necessity of an excuse for hovering about so near the
house, I feigned to be gathering wild flowers.</p>

<p>"Oh, aunt!" I heard Molly say as she came up,
"here is Dr. Crow, the gentleman that I spoke to you
about yesterday."</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Sykes!" said I, lifting my hat in the most
polite manner, "I hope I see you well this morning."</p>

<p>Molly gave me her hand, and introduced me to her
aunt, who curtseyed and smiled.</p>

<p>I said that I had come down here for a change of air,
and that I was amusing myself with botanising.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said the aunt. "So that is your
hobby, is it, Dr. Crow&mdash;well, and a very delightful one,
too. I am very fond of flowers myself, and only wish I
knew more about them. I do envy you scientific men.
You always seem so happy and contented."</p>

<p>"Well, madam," said I, "there is nothing like having
a hobby in life. It fills up many a weary hour and
makes us forget the din and the bustle of the busy
world around us. For my part, when I have no
patients to attend to, I am always occupied in some
way or other."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear me," said the aunt. "How very delightful!"</p>

<p>We walked on together, conversing agreeably as we
went, and afterwards I was invited into the house.
Need I say that I praised to the utmost the good taste
of everything I saw there, her paperhangings, her worsted
work, her crochet, etc. I was then shown some specimens
of ferns and wild flowers that she had dried in a
book, and she begged of me to write their classical
names under them.</p>

<p>This was indeed a trial, as I had never learnt a
single word of Latin, but it would not do to back out, so
I exerted all my ingenuity to invent some crackjaw
names. Among the rest I remember inscribing the
words "<i>Rodus sidus</i>," "<i>Stenchius obnoxious</i>," and
"<i>Herbus unnonus</i>." These names delighted Molly's aunt
immensely, who believed she was already a Latin
scholar. I found my way so well into the aunt's
good graces that I was invited to call whenever I liked,
and frequently asked to dinner.</p>

<p>As I did not like to call every day, for fear it should
look bad, either Molly or Molly's aunt managed to
feel unwell on the days that I did not call, and they
found it necessary to send for me, so it came to much
the same thing, as I saw Molly every day. Molly's aunt
was one of that class of females who are always
imagining that something or other is the matter with
them. I soon saw, therefore, that to get thoroughly
into her good graces, I must humour her in her whims.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I made out that she had this, that, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the other&mdash;indeed, I forget what it was exactly that I
said ailed her&mdash;and promised to bring her some physic.
This quite won her heart, so I at once set about
making some liquorice water, endeavouring to disguise
the taste of the liquorice as much as possible by
adding salt, pepper, a little soap, some tobacco, and
other nauseous ingredients. I wonder the mess didn't
poison her, but so far from causing ill-effects, she
informed me that it had really done her good.</p>

<p>Whether the good it had done her only lay in her
imagination or whether the strange compound really did
possess a medicinal property I cannot tell (I can hardly
think the latter), but certain it was, she <i>did</i> seem better.
I believe the real fact of the matter to be this. Molly's
aunt was the daughter of a well-to-do retired butcher,
and like many of her class, had over-indulged in high
feeding, and consequently was always suffering from
overloaded stomach. The mess that I gave her made
her sick, and that, in reality, and not merely in imagination,
effected a cure.</p>

<p>I then put her on a lower diet, recommended her
plenty of walking exercise, and in a very short time
there was a complete change in her constitution. She
no longer felt dyspeptic and desponding, suffered no
longer from nervous headaches, in fact, in her own
words, she "felt quite a girl again." All the effect of
my wonderful medicine. This, of course, was a feather
in my cap, and she looked up to me more than ever.</p>

<p>A week and then a fortnight passed away, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
now thought it high time to break to the aunt my love
affair with her niece, and ask her consent to our
union. So I called upon her one morning and
requested to speak with her alone. She received me in
the back parlour, and begged me to take a seat. I did
so, and began thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ahem! Madam, I wished to talk to you upon a
matter of some delicacy."</p>

<p>"Good gracious, doctor! What can have happened?"
she exclaimed, observing a look of unwonted gravity in
my face.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, nothing," I said; "at least, nothing of
any great importance. Hear me. I am a physician of
a certain age and in very good practice." I paused.</p>

<p>"Well, Dr. Crow," said the aunt.</p>

<p>"And I am still a bachelor," I continued.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said she, wriggling about in her seat
and looking coy, as if she guessed I meditated a proposal,
and took the compliment to herself.</p>

<p>"Well, madam," said I, impatient to get through
this painful duty, "to cut a long story short, I am in
love with your charming niece."</p>

<p>"<i>Oh!</i> doctor," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>The "<i>Oh!</i>" was jerked out with a spasm truly
painful, and her countenance fell visibly.</p>

<p>"I dare say you were not prepared for such a
surprise, but I have known Miss Sykes now a long
time, and I never saw anyone who could suit me better
as a wife. Miss Sykes and I have talked the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
over together, and she only awaits her aunt's consent.
Thank you, thank you, madam," said I seizing her
hand, "I knew you would give it," before giving her an
opportunity either to consent or refuse.</p>

<p>"Molly!" I cried, "come and thank your kind
aunt for having given her consent to our happy union."</p>

<p>Molly entered, blushing and giggling.</p>

<p>"Come, Molly," said I, "come and thank aunt, for
now we shall be as happy as two birds in a nest. I'll
go and see about the licence, and we'll get married as
soon as ever we can."</p>

<p>I laughed and appeared very merry, repeatedly
seizing the aunt by the hand and patting her on the
shoulder before she had time to get a word out.</p>

<p>"Stay, sir," said she, at length, "I can do nothing
without the consent of my niece's father."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be easily obtained, I am quite sure,"
said I, hopefully. "We will at once write a note, and
all will be settled."</p>

<p>I brought her her desk, opened it, took out pen, ink,
and paper, and placing a chair for her, induced her to
write.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, looking over her shoulder as she wrote,
"that will do&mdash;not <i>too</i> cold. Say I am in a position to
make his daughter comfortable, and that you think it is
a very desirable match&mdash;yes, that's the sort of thing. Give
it to me, I'll take it to the post." So saying, I snatched
up the epistle, bounded from the house, and returned
shortly, as happy as if everything were already settled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>In due time came a reply from old Sykes, to the
purport that, though he would have chosen a younger
man for his daughter, yet on the whole, considering
that I had a pretty good business as a doctor, and
could keep her well, he saw no reason why he
should withhold his consent. Furthermore, he begged
the aunt that if his daughter were to be married to
hasten the marriage as much as possible, as young
Rashly had been missing for some time, and folks said
that he was down at H&mdash;&mdash; after her.</p>

<p>"Bravo! old Sykes," said I to myself, "Fortune
seems to favour me indeed."</p>

<p>The next step that I intended to take was to obtain
the consent of my father. Accordingly, I took leave of
Molly for a time, stating that I had to absent myself on
business, and promising a speedy return. I entered
the stage and arrived at our village, where I put up at
my father's inn. It was towards evening when I arrived.</p>

<p>"Landlord!" I cried, disguising my voice, "I wish
to dine in half-an-hour."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said my father, coming towards me,
bowing, and rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>"Have you got a good bed?" asked I, "for I wish
to sleep here to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, capital beds, sir," said my father, "both
clean and well aired."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, make me up one," said I,
pompously.</p>

<p>"It shall be done, sir," said my father, obsequiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>I occupied myself with reading until dinner-time.
At length the dinner came up.</p>

<p>"A pint of your best port, landlord," I cried,
magnificently.</p>

<p>My father returned with the port, crusted and cob-webbed,
from the cellar, and I began my dinner. Having
finished, I filled my pipe, and whilst my father cleared
the table, I deigned to enter into conversation with him.</p>

<p>I began by asking him the number of inhabitants in
the village, and then brought him out upon the subject
of the epidemic.</p>

<p>"Ah! sir," said my father, deeply moved, "it
carried off my only son some three weeks ago, and a
finer lad you wouldn't see in all England. I hoped that
he would have been the prop of my old age, but he was
carried off, sir, along with the rest&mdash;struck down in the
very spring of his youth, as you may say. Only nineteen
was my poor boy when he was taken from me,"
and my father's eyes moistened as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Only nineteen!" I exclaimed. "Was he not
strong?"</p>

<p>"Strong, sir! I believe you&mdash;strong as a lion,"
said my father.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" I said, "it is very strange that his
youth and strength did not resist the malady."</p>

<p>"So everyone said, sir," replied my father, "but&mdash;but
he had been ailing for some time before."</p>

<p>"What was his complaint before he caught this
disease?" I asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! sir, that's just the point," answered my father.
"I sadly fear that it was an epidemic of a more dangerous
sort."</p>

<p>"How so?" asked I. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, my real opinion is now that the young
man was too strongly attached to a maid whom he
couldn't marry, and that undermined his health. Then
came the epidemic, which he had not sufficient strength
to shake off."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said I, "and why could he not marry her?
Was the maid unrelenting?"</p>

<p>"Not that, exactly, sir. Indeed, I believe she was
as much in love with him, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"Well, the fact of the matter is, sir, the girl's father
and I ain't friends, and neither of us was willing to give
our consent. The girl was sent off by her father to live
at her aunt's, just to get her out of my son's way. I
knew all about this, but I wasn't going to tell the young
man, lest he should take it into his head to run after
her, so, thinking to blunt his passion, I invented the
story of her death, saying that she had been carried off
by the epidemic, hoping that after a time, finding she
was no more, that he would cease to think of her. But
instead of that, he grew worse and worse, and I attribute
his death to the lie I told about his sweetheart's
decease."</p>

<p>"You did very wrong," said I, "not to give your
consent."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, but, sir, if I <i>had</i> given <i>mine</i>, the girl's father
would not have given <i>his</i>," replied my father.</p>

<p>"If you had been the first to make up the quarrel,
I have no doubt that he would have given his consent,"
said I.</p>

<p>My father seemed stung with this reproach, and
took out his handkerchief to wipe his eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, my poor son! my poor son!" sobbed my
father. "What wouldn't I give to have him back
again?"</p>

<p>"Would you give your consent to his marriage with
the girl he loved if he could come to life again?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Ay, sir, that would I, only too gladly," replied my
father, "but what's the use of talking now that he has
gone from me for ever?"</p>

<p>"You speak like a man without faith," said I.
"Have you no belief in an after life? Have you no
hope of meeting him in Heaven?"</p>

<p>"That is the only hope I have left, sir," said my
father, "but in the meantime&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said I, "you cannot make up your mind to
be consoled for his loss for the few short years that you
have to remain upon earth."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it's very hard to bear," said my father.</p>

<p>"Have you ever prayed?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said he, "I say my prayers regularly."</p>

<p>"But do you say them earnestly?" said I. "Do
you believe that if you ask a thing that you will receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
what you ask for? For instance, if you were to pray
for your son to be restored to life, do you believe that
he really <i>would</i> be restored to life?"</p>

<p>My father stared in surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, to tell you the truth, sir, no," he said; "for
we all know that when a man has been buried three
weeks that he rarely returns. Even Lazarus was but
four days under the earth. In fact, the thought of
praying for his return after his spirit had once been
yielded up never occurred to me. When David was
bereaved of his child by Uriah's wife, he humbled
himself whilst the child was yet alive with sackcloth
and ashes, but when he heard that the child was dead,
he rose and ate bread. What instance is there on
record of one returning to life after being buried three
weeks?"</p>

<p>"Pray, nevertheless," said I; "the mercy of God is
boundless. Who knows but that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, sir," said my father, shaking his head,
"you but mock me; it cannot be."</p>

<p>"It is impious of you to say it cannot be. Nothing
is impossible with God," said I.</p>

<p>My father smiled faintly. I saw that he regarded
me as a kind of well meaning madman, and after
lighting my candle, he showed me the way to my room
and shut me in for the night.</p>

<p>My room was some few doors off from my father's.
I undressed and went to bed. I had not been in bed
more than an hour when I heard my father's footsteps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
on the stairs. He, too, was going to bed. There was
no other guest in the inn then, and all was quiet.</p>

<p>I allowed my father a quarter of an hour to get into
bed. Then I opened my chamber door, and listened
to hear if he was praying, for he always prayed aloud.
I was satisfied that he was praying; what the precise
words were I could not quite distinguish, but I fancied
I heard my name mentioned once or twice. I
returned to my chamber and closed the door. I
allowed my father another hour to go to sleep. When
the time had expired, I stepped on tip-toe across the
passage and turned the handle of his bedroom door
noiselessly. I peeped in. All was silent, or rather he
was snoring loudly. Leaving the door ajar, I went back
cautiously to my chamber to fetch the candle, and then
softly and noiselessly I entered the room where my
father lay asleep. I had provided myself with a pinch
of salt, which I sprinkled in the flame, so as to give a
look of ghostly pallor to my face. Then, tapping my
father lightly on the shoulder, he started up in bed.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he cried, with every hair erect on
his head&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jack! is it you?"</p>

<p>He spoke huskily, and his teeth chattered.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said I, in a sepulchral voice; "listen
to me. Because you have prayed fervently, I have
risen from my grave to comfort you. Grieve not for
me, father, for I am happy. I have returned to thank
you for having given your consent to my marriage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Molly is now mine in spirit, and I shall henceforth rest
peacefully in my tomb. Farewell."</p>

<p>I strode towards the door, with long, silent, majestic
strides, and closed it carefully after me, leaving my
father staring after me into space and speechless with
terror.</p>

<p>I was a very young man then, and a reckless devil-may-care
sort of fellow, otherwise I should not have
attempted such a dangerous practical joke. The consequences
might have been fatal; as it was, my father's
nerves were terribly shaken, and I spoilt all his night's
rest. When he brought up my breakfast the next
morning in the parlour he looked pale and haggard.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, good man?" said I, patronisingly,
in my usual feigned voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir!" said my father, excitedly, "I saw him
last night!"</p>

<p>"Saw him!" I exclaimed. "Saw whom?"</p>

<p>"My son, Jack, sir. Oh, who would have
believed it?"</p>

<p>"What! and has he returned to life, or was it his
spirit?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, his ghost," said my father, with a look of
awe, and then he began relating to me the whole
particulars of his son's spiritual apparition.</p>

<p>"Then you followed my advice, and have been
praying?"</p>

<p>"That I did, sir, with all my heart and soul," said
my father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"You told me last evening," said I, "that if your
son should come to life again you would give your
consent to his marriage. If you really repent having
withheld your consent during his lifetime let me see
that your repentance is true by writing me the following
words and affixing your signature."</p>

<p>"What words, sir, must I write?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Write," said I, "'If my son is restored to me I will
give my consent to his marriage, with the girl of his
choice,' that is what you have to write."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" began my father.</p>

<p>"Write what I tell you, and affix your signature,"
said I, gruffly.</p>

<p>"As you like, sir," said he, complying with my
request. I blotted the sheet of paper, and placed it in
my pocket.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said I to my father, "I have a secret to
tell you. Do not faint, but be prepared for a shock."</p>

<p>My father looked at me in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Your son lives," said I.</p>

<p>"What do I hear?&mdash;my son&mdash;my son lives?" he
exclaimed, staggering backwards. Then recovering
somewhat his composure, he asked, "But how? I
myself saw him laid in the ground; besides, I tell you
I saw his ghost last night."</p>

<p>"That was nothing but a distempered dream
brought on by our conversation before you retired to
rest," said I. "I tell you your son lives&mdash;he is in my
care. Listen; but what I am about to tell you, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
must keep to yourself, otherwise it will damage my
reputation. Hearing that your son had been buried, I,
being a doctor and in want of a subject for dissection,
employed resurrectioners or body-snatchers to procure
me your son's body. They stole it from his grave and
brought it to my house. When I began to dissect I
found that he was not yet dead. He has been at my
house ever since, still very weak from his recent illness.
He has related to me his love affair, and knows of the
deception that you practised upon him. He begged
me to procure for him his father's consent to his
marriage, otherwise, he said he might die in real
earnest."</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor, doctor!" cried my father, "can it be
true? Oh, say that you are not jesting with me. Do
not trifle with the feelings of a poor man!"</p>

<p>"I never trifle," I replied, with dignity.</p>

<p>"Then it is true, doctor, really true! O God be
praised," and he clasped his hands convulsively, whilst
the tears ran down his cheeks.</p>

<p>Suddenly his ecstasy abated, and he grew serious.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, but, doctor, if&mdash;if after all what I saw last
night were not a dream&mdash;if whilst during your absence
from home, my son really has died, and appeared to me
last night to let me know. What proof have you that
the vision of my son last night <i>was</i> a dream?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"What proof?" I exclaimed. "<i>This</i> proof," I cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
throwing off my disguise and speaking in my own
natural voice again. "Behold me, father, risen from
the dead!"</p>

<p>My father's surprise, consternation and joy was
beyond all description.</p>

<p>"What!" he cried, "and are you really Jack risen
from the grave? Come, let me touch you to be sure
you are no ghost.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! Ha! ha! ha!" he laughed, hysterically.
"What! Jack, my boy, I see it all. Ha! ha!
ha! ha!" and he wept upon my shoulder till I thought
he'd go off in a fit.</p>

<p>"Hush! father," I cried, "and calm yourself. My
resurrection must be a secret between us two, for
motives of policy. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Why a secret?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Never mind now; that is part of my plan. If you
tell a single soul you'll spoil all, and I am a ruined
man," I said.</p>

<p>"I understand nothing of all this, Jack," said my
father, "but you may count upon my secrecy; but I say,
Jack, how long must I keep the secret, for I am burning
to tell everyone in the village?"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, hold your tongue," said I,
"until I give you permission to let it out, or I am
ruined for life."</p>

<p>"Well, well, Jack, mum's the word," said my father.</p>

<p>I then resumed my disguise and prepared to leave
the inn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, what the devil are you going to be up to
now?"</p>

<p>"Mum's the word," said I. "You shall know all
when I return. Good-bye, father," and off I started.</p>

<p>I busied myself a good deal about getting everything
in order for the wedding, and returned to H&mdash;&mdash;, where
without further bother I was married at the
village church.</p>

<p>Fearful that if I threw off my disguise before the
wedding that something or other, I could not tell what
or from what quarter, would mar all and prevent the
marriage just at the last moment, after having been so
successful up to this time, this feeling, or presentiment
of harm, vague as it was, induced me to keep on my
disguise all through the ceremony, but when it came to
signing my name in the register, I signed my real name&mdash;"John
Hearty."</p>

<p>This created some sensation.</p>

<p>The aunt wanted me to explain myself. However,
we hurried back to the aunt's house, where we at once
threw off my disguise, explained all, and craved pardon
for the deception I had practised upon her.</p>

<p>At first the aunt seemed a little cold. She was hurt
at the deception being carried on so long.</p>

<p>There was no necessity for such tricks, she said, if
she had been told all at the beginning; nothing would
have been known to anyone else.</p>

<p>"Do you think I would trust a woman's tongue?"
I said. "Come, now, aunt," I said, "though I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
a doctor, I did you quite as much good as a court
physician could have done you. Yes, although the
medicine was only liquorice water mixed up with other
harmless filth."</p>

<p>"In that, too, I've been imposed upon, then,"
murmured the aunt.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I cured you," retorted I; "you
yourself admitted it, and what is more, I took no fee."</p>

<p>Soon, however, Molly's aunt recovered her good
humour, and all passed off with a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>The only difficulty now was to reconcile ourselves
with Molly's father. The comedy was nearly at an
end. I donned my disguise once more, and we started
off together after the wedding breakfast to our native
village, and driving up to old Sykes' house, we knocked
at the door.</p>

<p>We entered, and I introduced myself as his son-in-law.
He received us well, and wished us both health
and prosperity. I did not know exactly how to break
the ice, so I reflected a moment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sykes," said I, still in my feigned voice, "I
shall expect you this evening to dine with me at six
o'clock at the 'Headless Lady.' Come, I will take no
refusal. If we are to be friends together, I shall
expect you, if not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He began to make an excuse about his gouty leg,
saying that he never left the house.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense," said I, "that is just the reason
you never get well. Going out now and then will do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
you good. I am a doctor, you know, and I advise you
for your good. If you do not like to walk, make use
of our coach."</p>

<p>He still hesitated, and at length said, "Well, the
fact is, I never go to that house. The landlord and I
are not friends. We have had some differences
together of long standing, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said I, "that is no excuse at all. All
men have differences now and then, but we must learn
to forget and forgive."</p>

<p>"No," said Sykes; "he was very much in the wrong."</p>

<p>"Well, I've no doubt that he thinks you are in the
wrong," said I. "Dine with me this evening there, and
I'll undertake to make matters straight for you both.
Hearty is a good and honest man, and is one of my
best friends. I have known him these nineteen years.
If you refuse to come, it will be an offence to me,
mind that."</p>

<p>After a time I succeeded in softening him down a
little, till I at length drew from him a reluctant consent,
and, according to his word, he appeared that evening
at our inn.</p>

<p>A grand dinner was prepared, before partaking of
which I succeeded in joining the hands of the two
bitter enemies.</p>

<p>Seeing that the hour had arrived for the divulging of
the secret I explained all in a few words, threw off my
disguise and craved his blessing.</p>

<p>Old Sykes was a crusty sort of a cove, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
expected that there would have been a scare, but we
had got him into a good humour previously, and he
was so much amused, in spite of himself, at the whole
scheme that he wrung my hand heartily and laughed
much over my odd adventures.</p>

<p>Dinner passed off gaily, and I secretly put the
doctor in possession of his old clothes again. I paid
him the money I owed him, and for ever kept secret
the name of the doctor who had brought me to life
again so cleverly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Why, Jack," said Mr. Oldstone, at the conclusion of
our host's recital, "you can tell a story like the best of us."</p>

<p>"Ay, that he can indeed," chimed in Mr. Crucible
and Mr. Hardcase.</p>

<p>"There is a great deal of poetry in Jack's story,"
remarked Mr. Parnassus.</p>

<p>Mr. Blackdeed said that it ought to be adapted to
the stage.</p>

<p>"And was it ever discovered who unearthed you,
Jack?" inquired Dr. Bleedem, who had a fellow feeling
for the Dr. Slasher of Jack's narrative, as he could
imagine what his own feelings would have been had he
fallen a victim to the infuriated villagers.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied our host, "I never let out the
truth, although I was pestered with questions all day
long by every one in the village. At length, however,
an old doctor in these parts died from the epidemic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and after his death, I gave out to the villagers that he
was the man who had dug me up."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Dr. Bleedem, "there was no harm in
that."</p>

<p>"And the two body-snatchers, did you ever see
<i>them</i> again?" asked Professor Cyanite.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed our host, "and that <i>was</i> a
joke, surely. One evening, shortly after my resurrection,
leastways before everyone knew that I had come
to life again, I was strolling through the cemetery alone
where I had been buried, and sitting down upon my
own grave, I began meditating upon my miraculous
escape from death, when who should pass by but my
two friends, Tom and Bill. I looked up as they
passed. You should have seen how they took to their
heels. My eyes! I shall never forget it."</p>

<p>"That was a rare joke, indeed," said our artist,
"and that other young fellow, young Rashly, did you
see any more of him?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sir," replied our host, "and that was another
good joke. The Sunday after our marriage I appeared
in the village church with Molly. How the people did
stare, to be sure! I recognised young Rashly in the
Squire's pew with his father. He could not see me, as
I was behind a pillar, and he had not yet heard of my
coming to life again. Seeing that he was without a
hymn book, I stepped out suddenly from my pew, and
crossing the aisle, offered him mine. I never shall
forget his face. He turned as pale as a ghost, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
obliged to support himself against the back of the pew.
He was nigh fainting, and his father was obliged to lead
him out of church."</p>

<p>"Your resurrection must have made quite a sensation
in the village then," said McGuilp.</p>

<p>"My word, it did, sir, and no mistake," answered the
landlord. "Everybody in the village and for miles round
it wanted to shake me by the hand and welcome me back
to life. People used to come from long distances to
hear me recount my adventures, till I grew quite sick of
it, and shut myself up and wouldn't see nobody."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, tedious work I've no doubt, telling the
same story over and over again to every new comer,"
said Mr. Oldstone.
"But tell us, Jack, did young Rashly ever discover
who it was that gave him the thrashing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that, too, came out in time," said our host,
"and devilish sheepish he looked, so they said, when
he heard it was his old rival in disguise. He would
have liked to have had me up about it before the
assizes, but he didn't like the idea of exposing himself,
and so the matter dropped. After a time, however,
finding that all the boys in the village laughed at him
whenever he walked abroad, he went to London, and I
have never heard anything more of him."</p>

<p>At this moment someone knocked at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" called out several voices at once.</p>

<p>The door opened ajar, and the head of our hostess
timidly appeared at the aperture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Beg pardon, gentlemen," said that worthy dame, "but
could Helen be spared a little just to help me a bit?"</p>

<p>"Oh! how very annoying!" cried our artist, "just
as the weather is clearing up and I was making up my
mind for a long sitting."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I can't do without her, sir, just now,"
said our hostess, "but if you wouldn't mind waiting an
hour or so, she will be at liberty."</p>

<p>"An hour without Helen!" exclaimed several
members at once. "Oh, impossible! and then to be
snatched from us again so soon!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, Mr. McGuilp, and you, too,
Dame Hearty," said Mr. Oldstone, "you are to blame,
both of you. Such conduct can't be suffered to go
unpunished; therefore, in the name of the club I
condemn you both to contribute to the common
entertainment by telling a story, each of you, when next
called upon."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" cried several voices.</p>

<p>"Yes, a story from Dame Hearty, and a still longer
one from Mr. McGuilp for having robbed us of Helen&mdash;a
most just sentence!"</p>

<p>"Oh, gentlemen!" said our hostess modestly. "You
wouldn't care to hear any of my stories; besides, I've
forgotten them all long ago."</p>

<p>"Come now, Dame Hearty, there is no backing
out," said Mr. Oldstone. "A sentence is a sentence."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if it must be so, I'll try and think of one
whenever the gentlemen of this respectable club choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to command my services. Come, Helen!" And our
hostess led away her fair daughter by the hand amidst
the groans of her ardent admirers.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. McGuilp," said Mr. Oldstone as the door
closed after Helen and her mother, "we have a full
hour before us. I call upon you to fill up that period to
the satisfaction of the club."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" shouted a chorus of voices; "out with
it; no mercy on him. Let justice be done."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, if you will allow me a moment to
compose myself, I'll endeavour to satisfy you," said our
artist. Then resting his head on his hand as if to call
up from the depths of his memory some long-forgotten
tale or legend, he said, "Gentlemen, I recollect a story
in our family, handed down to me from some remote
ancestor. I used to be frightened with it in my childhood.
It is long ago now since I heard it related, but
I will endeavour to give it you as perfectly as possible
after the lapse of so many years."</p>

<p>"Well, we're all attention," said one of the members.</p>

<p>Then our artist, after stretching himself, folded his
arms and commenced the following tale&mdash;</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/005.jpg" width="401" height="600" alt="" title="" /></div>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>Der Scharfrichter.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;The Artist's Second Story.</h3>

<p>A respectable ancestor of mine, far back in the
middle ages, went to study at a German university. I
cannot call to mind the name of it, but that is of no
consequence. I think he studied medicine, but I will
not be sure even of that. I know that he belonged to
a "chor," or company of students who pride themselves
on their liberty, who have their own laws and customs,
who fight duels with rival chors, and who settle disputes
among themselves by outvying each other in the drinking
of beer, who revel in street brawls and other such
respectable amusements, playing practical jokes upon
the peaceful citizens; in fact, making night hideous.</p>

<p>I know not whether my ancestor was any better or
any worse than his fellow students, but he seems to
have entered with pleasure into all their amusements,
and never to have held himself aloof when any mischief
was going on. He was consequently looked up to
rather than otherwise by his companions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the custom then, and still is among Germans,
especially among German students, to travel long
distances on foot, going together often in large numbers
and putting up at night, if they could, at some inn; if
not, in some cottage, stables, or loft, with nothing but
straw to sleep upon.</p>

<p>But German students are not pampered mortals, and
can put up with very homely accommodation. If after
a fatiguing day's march a student can find at his quarters
sufficient beer, black bread, sausage, raw ham, or a little
strong cheese, he is perfectly satisfied. Should he be
so fortunate as to light upon a dish of "sauer kraut," he
would fancy himself in the seventh heaven.</p>

<p>The German is hardy, yet studious, highly sensitive,
and keenly susceptible to the beauties of nature.
Though somewhat penurious, he is fond of good fellowship,
and is a staunch friend.</p>

<p>The foot tour in Germany is a thing common to all
classes, from the nobility down to the "handwerksbursch,"
or journeying mechanic, which latter class is
often unmercifully persecuted by the university student.
From time immemorial there seems to have been a
feeling of animosity between the two classes, as nearer
home we find existing between the "town and gown."</p>

<p>The German student of the middle ages, as in our
times, was fond of swagger, delighted in wearing high
boots, enormous spurs, an exaggerated sword, a preposterous
hat, was provoked to a duel on the slightest
occasion, boasted of the number of "schoppen" or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
"seidel" of beer that he could stow away beneath his
doublet, and ran up long bills without a thought of how
they were to be paid.</p>

<p>In those days every student had his guitar or other
musical instrument wherewith to serenade his "Liebchen"
or lady-love, for that latter article was indispensable
to the life of a student, and though much
grossness and barbarity has been attributed to him, he
is, nevertheless, at times capable of being elevated by
a pure and refined passion, for he has much poetry in
his nature, and is both sentimental and romantic in the
extreme.</p>

<p>In all ages students have meddled much in politics,
and princes have been known to tremble before their
audacity and resolution.</p>

<p>But enough of this digression, gentlemen. My
present tale demands only that you should call up in
your minds the German student on his foot tour in the
long vacation, with his keen relish of the beautiful, his
lusty and well-trained frame that laughs at fatigue, his
love of good-fellowship, his tender thoughts of home
with the image of his lady-love.</p>

</div>

<p>I must now return to my ancestor, who at the time
this story commences was on one of these pedestrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
rambles, accompanied by some twenty of his fellow students,
all stout, hearty youths who could eat, drink,
and fight with any in the university, and flirt, too, I've
no doubt, when occasion tempted them.</p>

<p>These attributes, you will say, are not strictly
necessary to the student preparing for honours, yet,
nevertheless, somehow German students manage to
find time for other amusements besides dry study.
They <i>can</i> play, but when they <i>do</i> study, they study
hard.</p>

<p>My ancestor at the time I speak of was a young
man of about twenty, and had already been two years
at the university. We may presume, therefore, that he
spoke German tolerably well, if not well.</p>

<p>I believe it was in the Harz mountains, the
Th&uuml;ringer Wald, and about those parts that he was
travelling on foot with his friends.</p>

<p>They rose at daybreak and walked hard, with their
knapsacks on their backs, singing or conversing as they
went, reposing at noon in some shady spot to avoid the
heat of the day. When the sun began to abate a little
they would resume their journey till night overshadowed
them, when they would encamp, as hungry as hunters,
in some rude quarters, where they would make merry
together over a simple but plentiful supper, and talk
over the fatigues of the day.</p>

<p>They had been following this sort of life for some
time, when one evening as they were hastening towards
their quarters in groups of twos, threes, and fours, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
ancestor asked of his friend, "What is the name of the
township where we are to sleep to-night, Hans?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;dorf," answered his friend; "but we shall
have to hasten in order to reach it before nightfall.
Look, how the mist is rising!"</p>

<p>"Ah! so it is," replied my relative, whose name
was Frederick, but who was never called otherwise than
"Fritz" by his companions.</p>

<p>Our Fritz had remained behind to enjoy the last
dying glow of a gorgeous sunset, and was wrapt in meditation,
while his friend Hans hurried on.</p>

<p>"Now then, Fritz!" cried one, Max, "don't lag
behind so; or are your English legs not strong enough
for our German mountains?"</p>

<p>Our Englishman was stung at this taunt, implying,
as it did a disparagement of himself and countrymen,
however undeserved it was, for the Germans knew
that he could outwalk the best of them when he chose.
Yet it had the effect of making him hasten his steps a
little.</p>

<p>The dusky hue of night fast overshadowed our
students, and the mist now rose at their feet in thick
clouds, so that it was with the utmost difficulty that
they could find their way.</p>

<p>My ancestor was still a long distance behind the
rest, but he was gaining fast on them, when in the
darkness, he stumbled over a clump of rock and
sprained his ankle. All hope of catching up his companions
was now gone. The most he could do was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
hobble on slowly with the help of his staff, now losing
his way, now finding it, whenever the moon peeped out
to light up his path, then losing it again when the moon
hid itself behind a cloud, till he began to despair of
ever finding anything in the shape of a roof to shelter
him from the night air during sleep, and he more than
half made up his mind to encamp on the spot, but
just then he felt a large drop of rain on his face, then
another, and another.</p>

<p>It had been a broiling hot day, and the air was still
sultry. Presently a flash of vivid forked lightning
danced before his eyes, followed by a clap of thunder
so terrific that it bid fair to burst the drum of his ear.</p>

<p>The storm was now overhead; the flashes grew
more frequent and more vivid, and the thunder growled
more fiercely than ever. In a few minutes the rain
poured down in torrents, and the English student was
drenched to the skin.</p>

<p>"Here is a nice situation for a man on a pleasure
trip!" muttered my ancestor to himself. "Lost, in the
dead of night, in the midst of a thunderstorm, in an
open plain without shelter, drenched like a drowned rat,
as hungry as a wolf, and hardly able to crawl, from a
sprained ankle!"</p>

<p>His reflections were anything but of a pleasing sort,
as you may imagine, yet he hobbled on as best he
could, endeavouring to comfort himself with the vague
hope of finding some sort of shelter for the night as
soon as the storm should pass off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>After dragging on his limbs with exemplary patience
for another half-mile, it being then about midnight, he
perceived a light from a cottage window not very far
distant. His courage began to revive, and with halting
gait he made for the door of the cottage.</p>

<p>He knocked loudly, but no one answered. Thinking
that he had not been heard for the rumbling of the
thunder, he knocked again and again. Still no one
came to the door.</p>

<p>"I mean to lodge here for the night," said the
Englishman to himself, "if I have to break the door
open to effect an entrance." And he kept up a furious
knocking for about three-quarters-of-an-hour. At length
he heard a harsh, grating voice within break out in a
string of choice Teutonic oaths, and the word "schweinhund"
(pig-dog) pronounced once or twice.</p>

<p>Footsteps were then heard descending the stairs,
and the next moment a quaint-looking personage
appeared at the door in dressing-gown and slippers, with
night-cap on head and candle in hand, and demanded
in a surly tone what the "teufel" he wanted at that
hour of night.</p>

<p>My ancestor apologised with much courtesy for
having roused up so worthy an individual at such an
unearthly hour, but pleaded that he was a poor benighted
traveller, hungry and soaked to the skin.</p>

<p>"Then you should have moved further on," was the
curt reply.</p>

<p>"But whither?" asked my relative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"To the township. This house is not a 'wirtshaus.'"</p>

<p>"How far distant is it?"</p>

<p>"A mile."</p>

<p>By this he meant a German mile&mdash;equal to four
English miles.</p>

<p>"A mile!" exclaimed the Englishman. "I could
not walk a mile to save my life. I've sprained my
ankle and can't move a step further. I'm sorry to put
you to such inconvenience, my good fellow, but I really
must put up here."</p>

<p>"But there is no accommodation," growled the
inmate.</p>

<p>"No matter. I dare say you have a little straw; if
not, the bare ground will do."</p>

<p>The inmate sulkily suffered the traveller to enter,
and showing him into a parlour on the ground-floor, was
about to leave him to himself.</p>

<p>"Stop a bit, my good host," said the student. "I
must beg to remind you that I am as hungry as a wolf,
and as cold as an icicle. If you could find me
something in your larder to keep soul and body
together, and light me a nice little fire to dry my
clothes, you will make me your friend for life."</p>

<p>"Food! Fire! at this time of night!" exclaimed
the host, with a look that seemed to say, "Is the man
mad?"</p>

<p>"My dear friend," said the Englishman, putting his
hand in his pocket and passing a Reichsgulden into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
hand of his host, "I do not want you to do anything
for me gratis. Make me as comfortable as you can for
that&mdash;on my departure I'll give you more."</p>

<p>"Oh, mein Herr!" said our host, softening at the
touch of the bright metal, "that alters the case entirely.
You shall have everything you want. I am sorry I
haven't another bed, but you can have some straw, and
a fire to dry your clothes. I'll go and see directly what
there is in the house by way of refreshment, for you
must be hungry indeed!"</p>

<p>Our host left the apartment, and returned shortly
with some firewood and a heap of straw.</p>

<p>To light a fire and arrange the straw for the traveller
in a corner of the room was the work of a moment.
He then hurried off to get supper ready, and returned
soon afterwards with a dish of sausage, some black
bread, some strong cheese and a bottle of "schnaps."</p>

<p>"Our fare is homely, you see, sir," said the host,
apologetically; "but it is all we have in the house.
We are poor people, and not accustomed to entertain
travellers."</p>

<p>"Never mind that, mine host," said the student, "as
long as there is plenty of it, we'll excuse the quality."</p>

<p>So saying, he began to strip himself and to hang his
clothes before the fire. Then taking from his knapsack
a clean shirt and another pair of hose, he donned his
slippers and drew his chair close to the table.</p>

<p>The host, after trimming a lamp and lighting it,
placed it in the centre of the table, and was just about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to return to his bed, when the student called out with
his mouth full of sausage, "What! mine host, will you
not honour me with your company whilst I discuss my
supper? Company helps digestion, you know, and I'm
sure you wouldn't like to have my undigested supper on
your conscience."</p>

<p>The host returned with a grunt, saying that he
couldn't stop long, as he had to rise early on the
morrow.</p>

<p>"Oh, so have I, good mine host," said my ancestor,
"so we are equal. Come, sit down here, and let me
see you toss off a glass or two of this most excellent
schnaps. It will keep out the cold and give you
pleasant dreams, besides adding a still richer tint to that
glorious nose of yours."</p>

<p>"Humph!" replied the host, little pleased at this
personal allusion; but he drew a chair to the table and
made an effort at being sociable.</p>

<p>My ancestor until now had hardly had time to give
more than a cursory glance at the features of his host,
but finding himself now at table opposite him, he took
a minute survey of his countenance in all its details.</p>

<p>The exterior of our host was striking, to say the
least. He was a man of about five-and-forty, of middle
height, broad rather than tall. His neck and chest
might have served as a model for the Farnese Hercules.
His hair and beard, which were matted and unkempt,
were of a flaming red, and he was just beginning to turn
bald. His brow was low, knotted, and streaked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
red. His eyebrows, which were of the same tint as his
hair, were enormous, and overhung a pair of small,
deep-set brown eyes that moved furtively from right to
left with the rapidity of lightning, giving to his countenance
a remarkably sinister expression.</p>

<p>His complexion was florid, and the nose, which was
large and bottle-shaped, was of so bright a red that it
made the eyes water to look upon it, and spoke little
for its owner's temperance. His ears, large and red,
stood out at the sides of his head like those of an
animal, and their orifices were carefully protected by
fierce tufts of red hair. The back part of his head was
excessively developed, and the jaw was large and
massive. His arms were very muscular, and hairy as
an ape's, with strongly-defined purple veins, and his
hands, the fingers of which were short and stunted,
were the colour of raw meat. The legs were somewhat
short for the body, and slightly bowed.</p>

<p>My ancestor, as he scanned the grim features of his
host, could not help imagining himself a prince in a
fairy-tale who had been lured by the evil genius of the
storm into the castle of some ogre, who would sooner
or later devour him unless rescued by the good fairies.
The ogre was not a communicative person. He had
not opened his mouth once since he had taken his seat
at the table, save to toss down a glass of schnaps.</p>

<p>At length the Englishman, curious to know something
of the life and habits of this mysterious individual,
was the first to break silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"You live in a very isolated spot, mine host," said he.</p>

<p>"Ja," was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>"Have you no nearer neighbours than those of the
township?" demanded his guest.</p>

<p>"Nein," grunted the ogre.</p>

<p>"And do you enjoy this solitary existence?"
pursued the traveller.</p>

<p>"Ja!" was the inevitable monosyllabic response.</p>

<p>"I shall not get much out of him," said my ancestor
to himself, and again there was silence for the space of
five minutes.</p>

<p>As if searching for some topic wherewith to renew
the conversation, the student cast his eyes round the
apartment, taking in at a glance the minutest article of
furniture or other commodity that the room contained.</p>

<p>It was a homely, undecorated apartment, built after
the fashion of the period, and differed little from most
other apartments of the sort. If it was remarkable for
anything, it was for its extreme simplicity, not to say
nakedness, but there was one object hanging on the
wall that at once attracted the traveller's eye. It was a
two-handed sword of peculiar shape, and appeared
bright and sharp as if ready for use.</p>

<p>"Aha!" exclaimed the Englishman, fixing his eye
on the object, "you have been a soldier, I see."</p>

<p>"Not I," said the host.</p>

<p>"No? Ah! I see that your sword is not of the
same form as those used in battle. It is probably
antique&mdash;an heirloom, perhaps."</p>

<p>The man answered with a nod of the head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought so," said the stranger; "and yet it
seems bright and well cared for. It has evidently been
sharpened lately. Do you always keep it well
sharpened?"</p>

<p>"On great occasions, yes," was the reply, and our
host gave a peculiar wink, accompanying it with a
significant gesture with both hands, in imitation of
wielding the two-handed instrument over his head, then
slapping his own neck he uttered a low whistle and a
sort of chuckle thus: "Wh&mdash;ew!&mdash;click!" being his
mode of expressing the action of cutting off a head.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" exclaimed the Englishman, "is that
in your line?"</p>

<p>The ogre answered by a savage laugh.</p>

<p>At this moment the crying of a child was heard
overhead, together with the harsher tones of its mother
scolding it.</p>

<p>"Then you do not live perfectly solitary, as I
thought," said the student; "you have also wife and
children?"</p>

<p>"One boy only," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Ah! An only son&mdash;a great pet, I'll warrant,"
said his guest, finishing his last morsel of supper.
"What age may he be?"</p>

<p>"Ten years old&mdash;fine boy&mdash;just like me&mdash;bringing
him up like his father," said the strange individual.</p>

<p>"If he turns out like his father, he'll be a beauty,"
thought my ancestor. Then he asked aloud of his
host:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what profession may that be that you wish to
apprentice him to?"</p>

<p>"Like his father," was the curt reply; but it was
followed by the same sort of expressive gesture that I
have just described.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the student, "to cut off
people's heads?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the ruffian; "I am a Scharfrichter."</p>

<p>"A what?" inquired my ancestor, who though he
could make himself generally understood in German,
had never yet come across the word "Scharfrichter" in
his vocabulary.</p>

<p>"A Scharfrichter," repeated the man, raising his
voice. "Don't you know what that means? Why,
one who cuts off heads."</p>

<p>"An executioner!" muttered the foreigner, half-aloud.
"Have I been constrained to crave the hospitality
of an executioner?"</p>

<p>These words were inaudible to his host, but the
ruffian evidently observed a change in his guest's
countenance when he informed him of the nature of
his profession, for he hastened to reply.</p>

<p>"One sees at once that you are a foreigner, and
unused to the customs of this country. You shudder
at meeting an executioner, and sicken at the thought
of cutting off a head. No matter, it is always so at
first. In fact, the pleasure derived from seeing executions
is an acquired taste; but I'll show you some sport
to-morrow. There is to be some rare fun down at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
township at daybreak," and the wretch gave another
wink and a chuckle. "I'll show you how to cut off a
head. One blow&mdash;click!&mdash;cuts like cheese."</p>

<p>"Horrible being!" muttered my ancestor to himself
in his native tongue. "Is it possible that anything
human can actually revel in such brutality?" and he
shuddered in spite of himself. Then he said aloud
to his host&mdash;</p>

<p>"What was it that first gave you a taste for so
horrible a profession?"</p>

<p>"Hm! I hardly know. I had a natural genius for it, I
suppose. My father was a butcher, and I was brought up
from infancy to see cattle slaughtered. At a very early
age I took to slaughtering the animals myself. I seemed
to take a liking to it from the very beginning. I happened
to have an uncle at that time who was a Scharfrichter,
and my greatest delight was to see him cut off the heads
of the criminals. I began to long to do the same.</p>

<p>"I was a very young man when this uncle died, and
as he had no male issue to take his place, and no one
else seemed to come forward, I thought I would offer
my services, and they were accepted. I have been
headsman of the town these thirty years, and when I
die my son will step into my shoes."</p>

<p>"But if he doesn't take to it?"</p>

<p>"He <i>must</i> take to it&mdash;he'll <i>have</i> to take to it."</p>

<p>"Why, are there not many other noble professions
just as inviting as that of chopping off the heads of one's
fellow-mortals?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not for the son of a headsman. I see you are
ignorant of the laws of this country. Here in Germany
the son of a headsman is bound by law to adopt the
profession of his father, and should the executioner
have a daughter instead of a son, in that case, the man
who marries his daughter is bound to be headsman.
Then the Scharfrichter is obliged to build his house a
mile away from other men, for he is a being hated and
shunned by everyone."</p>

<p>"This then is the reason of your solitude?"</p>

<p>"It is; and so far is this superstitious fear of contamination
carried in this country, that your citizen
considers himself defiled if by chance he has eaten out
of the same plate that a headsman has once used.
Accordingly all vendors of crockery have orders to
knock a chip out of every earthen vessel that they sell
to the headsman."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed my ancestor, "what a peculiar
custom! I never heard that before. I certainly did
remark that your crockery was in a most dilapidated state,
but I didn't consider the remark worth making, although
more than once in the course of the evening I felt
inclined to ask you how on earth you contrived to knock
out chips of such a peculiar shape by mere accident."</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed the headsman, "what between the
crockery-seller and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he put his finger to his lip and looked round
the room suspiciously.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked the student.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush!" said the headsman, "it isn't always safe
to talk of mischievous people&mdash;they are apt to appear.
You know the saying, 'Talk of the devil.'"</p>

<p>"Well," said my ancestor, "but what has that to
do with your broken crockery?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" answered his host, looking round him
half-timidly; then whispered, "I have a certain
mischievous lodger that does my crockery more harm
than either the crockery-seller or my boy upstairs
when he's fractious."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the traveller in surprise, "you
have a lodger in your house?"</p>

<p>"Ay!&mdash;a lodger who never pays his rent, and who
drives me to my wit's end by shying my crockery at my
head. Look here, what a cut he gave my wrist once in
one of his pranks. I shall bear this mark to my grave."
So saying, he bared his wrist and displayed a deep,
livid wound, long since healed, but which left behind a
scar which nothing could efface.</p>

<p>"An ugly cut, to be sure," remarked the Englishman.
"But why on earth do you not get rid of so
playful a lodger?"</p>

<p>"Get rid of him! I only wish the devil I could.
He comes here uninvited and&mdash;&mdash; But let us not talk of
him, or he may pay us another of his pleasant visits,
when you will be able to make his acquaintance. He
never stands upon ceremony, but comes just whenever
he likes. He may be in the room now, for what I know.
I shall be off to bed."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>My ancestor gazed round the room, vainly endeavouring
to discover in some hidden nook the object
of his host's terror, when, marvellous to relate! a dish on
the top shelf was pitched, as if by some invisible hand,
from its post, and shattered into pieces against the
opposite wall, nearly hitting him on the head as it
passed.</p>

<p>The traveller stared first at the shelf, then at his
host, and turned pale.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" he cried. "What was that?"</p>

<p>"What was it? Ay! You may well ask what it is,"
answered his host, peevishly. "What in the devil's name
should it be but that pest of a 'Poltergeist' again. I
told you you would make his acquaintance ere long."</p>

<p>"A what?&mdash;a '<i>Poltergeist</i>'?"</p>

<p>"Ay, Poltergeist&mdash;a malignant spirit, whose chief
delight seems to be to strike terror into the house of a
poor honest headsman, and smash all his crockery that
he has to pay for out of his hard-earned wages."</p>

<p>"Holy Virgin!" ejaculated my ancestor, crossing
himself (for he was a good Catholic). "A malignant
spirit! Saints protect us!"</p>

<p>But the words were hardly out of his mouth when
crash! went another plate upon the floor, just grazing
his host's auburn head as it passed.</p>

<p>"Oh! come now, my fine fellow," said our host, in a
tone of mild remonstrance; "a little of that goes a long
way."</p>

<p>Then turning to his guest, he remarked:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder why he honours me especially with his
visits, and not other people. I shouldn't wonder if he
is someone that I have had the honour of decapitating,
and he comes to pay me an occasional visit in order to
impress upon me that he hasn't forgotten the little
service I did him."</p>

<p>A large pointed knife that lay peacefully on the table
was then suddenly and powerfully thrown from the
traveller's side, and remained with the point sticking in
the panel of the door opposite.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" cried the headsman; "this is getting
warm work. Now, my good friend, do let me entreat
you to be more moderate in your manifestations, and if
you are quiet, to-morrow I will send you a companion."</p>

<p>This promise, so far from quieting our spiritual
guest, seemed to infuriate him more than ever, for the
bottle of schnaps, more than half full, was now raised in
the air and dashed to pieces on the table, the candle
being overturned at the same time, and falling flame
downwards on to the spirit spilt on the table, it
ignited, and in a moment everything was in a blaze.</p>

<p>"Fire! Fire!" cried the headsman, in a voice that
roused up his wife and child, who came tumbling downstairs
in no time, to learn what was the matter.</p>

<p>There is no knowing what mischief might not have
taken place had not my ancestor, with great presence of
mind, snatched up his damp clothes from before the
fire, and succeeded in extinguishing the flame.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the matter, Franz?" exclaimed our host's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
better half, appearing at the door just as matters were
being set to rights again.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," said her fond spouse, "only that
d&mdash;&mdash;d Poltergeist again, who seems bent upon burning
us all in our beds before he has done with us."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said his wife, "don't swear, or he may do
as you say in real earnest. Come to bed now, or to-morrow
you won't be able to get up in time.
Remember&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, true; I must have my night's rest, as it would
not do for my hand to tremble to-morrow when I mount
the scaffold. <i>Gute nacht, mein Herr.</i>"</p>

<p>And our worthy host followed his partner out of
the room, leaving my ancestor to his reflections.</p>

<p>"Well," soliloquised my relative, "of all the strange
adventures that ever occurred to me, this beats all.
Oh! there is not the slightest doubt that what I have
just witnessed is the work of the infernal powers&mdash;some
diabolical agency.</p>

<p>"When I see a knife jump up from the table by
itself without anyone near and deliberately fix itself in
the panel of the door before my very eyes; when I see
a bottle of spirit overturned and broken in pieces, and
then a candle after that knocked over as if on purpose
to ignite the spirit, and withal no way of accounting for
such a phenomenon; moreover, when I see plates and
dishes hurled from one end of the room to the other,
and apparently aimed at people's heads, and yet the
perpetrator of such pranks has the power of making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
himself invisible to the naked eye, then, I say, this is
not through human agency, but something superhuman,
and as it is not exactly an angelic mode of proceeding,
it must be the reverse."</p>

<p>My ancestor shuddered, and crossed himself. The
manifestations, however, had ceased for the night, and
in five minutes our weary traveller was fast asleep.</p>

<p>His dreams that night were not of the pleasantest.
He imagined that he mounted the scaffold with a
crowd of eager eyes gazing at him, amongst whom were
his friends and travelling companions. His host, the
Scharfrichter, stood brandishing his terrible two-handed
sword, and in another moment his head would
have been off, but at the critical time the dream
changed, and he was being pelted with crockery in the
midst of a cemetery at night by innumerable sheeted
"poltergeister."</p>

<p>These and such-like visions were flitting before his
brain, when a loud thump at the door brought him back
to earth again. There was the Scharfrichter before him,
not in dressing gown and slippers, as on the previous
evening, but attired in doublet and hose of a blood red,
a black <i>barello</i> with scarlet cock's feather.</p>

<p>"Now then, mein Herr," said the headsman, taking
down his fearful instrument from the wall, "time's
up."</p>

<p>My ancestor, only just awake, rubbed his eyes and
imagined that he was really and truly called away to
execution, and that his last hour had come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The executioner, seeing that he hesitated, added:
"If you want to witness the cunning of my hand, now's
your time."</p>

<p>My relation gave a sigh of relief when he began to
recollect that his own head was quite safe, and that he
was only called to witness the execution of another
man.</p>

<p>"But I can't go; I have sprained my ankle,"
pleaded the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't intend to walk myself," replied the
executioner. "I have my horse and cart ready, and can
give you a lift."</p>

<p>"Oh, if that's the case," said the student, "I shall be
glad to go, as I wish to meet my friends in the township."</p>

<p>"Come on, then," and the headsman assisted the
Englishman into the cart.</p>

<p>As they were about starting, a little red-haired
ruffian of about ten, stout and well-built, and bearing a
striking likeness to our host, appeared on the threshold.</p>

<p>"Papa, you'll bring me home a football, won't you?"
said the youth.</p>

<p>"Ay, my boy, that will I, a good sized one,"
answered his father.</p>

<p>"That's your son?" asked the student of his host.
"Ah, a fine little fellow. Here, my little man," said
he to the child, and slipping a small coin into his little
fat fist, he patted him on the cheek and stepped into
the cart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, he's a fine boy," said our host with a paternal
pride, as he whipped on his horse. "There is nothing
of the milksop about him. <i>He's</i> not afraid of the devil
himself."</p>

<p>"You do well to be proud of him. I'll warrant you
buy him many a pretty toy," observed the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Buy him toys!" exclaimed the headsman, laughing.
"As long as I bring him home a football now and then,
he is quite content." And he laughed again.</p>

<p>"Well, that is a toy, isn't it?" said the student, not
as yet comprehending the headsman's meaning.</p>

<p>"Yes, a toy that costs me nothing, and gives him no
end of amusement. You should see how he kicks the
heads about that I bring him home. It's quite a
pleasure to see the youngster enjoy himself in his innocent
way."</p>

<p>"You do not mean to say," said the Englishman, in
horror, "that the football you promised him is to be <i>a
human head</i>!"</p>

<p>"Aye, to be sure," replied the Scharfrichter.
"What else should it be? What kicks he'll give it to
be sure! Ha! ha! ha! that's the way to bring up
boys; makes them hardy. <i>He's</i> not afraid of a little
blood. Talk of his not taking a liking to my business!
Why he's always saying to me, 'Papa, when I am big
enough to wield your sword, you'll let me cut off heads,
won't you?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, my boy, that you shall,' say I, for I like to
give him encouragement. That's what I call bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
up boys well. I wouldn't give a fig for one of your
milksops that scream or faint at the sight of blood,
not I."</p>

<p>"Humph," muttered my ancestor, and he remained
silent for some minutes, absorbed in meditation.</p>

<p>The headsman whipped on his horse in silence; at
length he said to his guest: "Here we are at last.
Look at yon crowd waiting to receive us."</p>

<p>My relative lifted his head, and sure enough there
was the mound of earth erected for the criminal already
surrounded by soldiers, close to which thronged the
crowd. All the inhabitants of &mdash;&mdash;dorf were astir,
and in the crowd our Englishman now recognised his
fellow students. A cry of "<i>Der Henker! der Henker!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
arose on all sides. Room was at once made for the
headsman and his companion, and Fritz's fellow students,
seeing their friend arrive in a Henker's cart, pushed
their way through the crowd to ask him all sorts of
questions.</p>

<p>Fritz descended with difficulty after paying his host
for his board and lodging, and joined his companions.
In a few minutes more the criminal's cart arrived with
the "<i>armer S&uuml;nder</i>," or poor sinner, accompanied by
two priests. Loud execrations broke from the mob,
amidst which the wretched being descended from the
cart and mounted the scaffold. A dead silence reigned
around. One of the priests whispered something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
earnestly in the ear of the condemned, who was as
pale as death, and he took his seat on the chair prepared
for him, while an expression of savage delight
appeared on the countenance of the headsman.</p>

<p>He felt all eyes were upon him. The terrible two-handed
weapon was raised aloft, and brandished over
the Henker's head. One blow and the head of the unhappy
wretch was severed from his body. Loud
cheering rent the air as the Scharfrichter, holding the
head of the criminal by the hair, presented it to the
public gaze. But at this moment a most unexpected
and revolting scene ensued.</p>

<p>Several persons from among the crowd rushed forward
toward the scaffold with mugs, which they filled at
the fresh fountain of blood spurting up from the severed
neck of the criminal and drank off at a draught.</p>

<p>My ancestor sickened at so disgusting a spectacle,
and demanded the reason of some bystander. He was
informed that those persons believed human blood fresh
from the neck of a beheaded criminal to be an infallible
remedy for epileptic fits. The superstition exists to this
day. Violent exercise after the draught, he was informed,
was considered necessary, in order to effect a cure.</p>

<p>The crowd began to disperse, and my ancestor,
leaning on the arm of a friend, also retired from the
scene, disgusted with himself at having been present at
such a spectacle. Before leaving the spot he had time
to notice his host of the previous night start off in his
cart towards home with the promised football.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Our English student was laid up for some little time
with his sprained ankle, and some of his companions
remained behind to keep him company, while others
moved onward.</p>

<p>The ankle being cured, my relative continued his
foot tour with his friends, and afterwards returned to
the university, where he studied hard till the time came
round for an examination, which he passed, and shortly
afterwards returned to England.</p>

<p>We hear nothing more of my ancestor until ten or
twelve years afterwards, when we again find him in
Germany, whither he had been suddenly called to visit
some relative, then in a dying state.</p>

<p>He arrived just in time to close his relative's eyes,
after which he saw him quietly interred in his last home.</p>

<p>This sad office over, he was thinking of returning to
England, when, in turning over the articles of his
travelling trunk, he suddenly came across a German
book belonging to a college friend of his, one Ludwig
Engstein, that had been lent him when at the university,
and which he had forgotten to return before leaving
college. His friend used to live, he remembered, in
Weimar, and not being far distant, he resolved to visit
that town and to find out his friend's house.</p>

<p>Many changes take place in twelve years, and my
ancestor only half expected to meet his fellow-student
again. He might have changed his residence&mdash;he
might be dead. Who could tell what might not have
happened to him after so long a lapse of time?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Englishman, finding himself on
German soil once more, resolved to enquire after the
friend of his youth, and should he succeed in discovering
him, to put him in possession of his book again, and
chat with him over their student days.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he set off for the town of Weimar, and
having arrived there, proceeded with the said book
under his arm to the house of his friend. He had been
once on a visit of a fortnight at his friend's house when
a student, and had known his mother and sisters intimately,
therefore he had no difficulty in finding the
house again.</p>

<p>The town of Weimar had changed but little during
these ten or twelve years, and once more he found himself
on the old familiar doorstep.</p>

<p>"<i>Ist der Herr Advocat Engstein zu Hause?</i>" he
demanded of an old woman who answered the door.</p>

<p>"<i>Ja, mein Herr</i>," replied the crone. "What name
shall I give?"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind announcing me," said the Englishman;
"I'll announce myself."</p>

<p>So saying, he pushed past the old woman, and
knocked at his friend's study.</p>

<p>"<i>Herein!</i>" called out a voice from within, which my
ancestor had no difficulty in recognising as his friend's,
and the Englishman entered.</p>

<p>Ludwig Engstein was seated at a table strewed with
papers and documents, and was busily writing. He
was still young looking, but his friend Fritz noticed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
his face had assumed a more thoughtful expression
than when at the university. He was now a lawyer in
good practice, and the moment his friend entered he
was so busy that he did not even raise his head.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to disturb you, Herr Advocat," said
Fritz, suddenly, "but I've come to return a book you
lent me some time back."</p>

<p>And placing the book on the table, he marched
straight out of the room, shutting the door after him.
He then peeped through the key-hole and listened
awhile to note the effect of his abrupt departure on his
friend.</p>

<p>The young lawyer's ear caught his friend's English
accent, and at once lifted his head, though not in time
to catch a glimpse of his retreating figure.</p>

<p>I have said that Engstein recognised Fritz's accent
as English, but little did he suspect that it was his old
college friend who had called upon him and left so
suddenly.</p>

<p>He looked surprised, took up the book upon the
table to look at the title, and muttered to himself,
"Who can it have been? I do not recollect now who
it was I lent it to, but it must have been a long while
ago."</p>

<p>He was about to ring the bell, and rose for that
purpose when he noticed a face peeping at him through
the opening of the door, which was now ajar.</p>

<p>"Who's that? Come in!" cried the lawyer.</p>

<p>"You are busy, Herr Advocat&mdash;another time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
<i>Ich empf&auml;hle mich Ihnen</i>," said my relative, closing
the door slowly after him.</p>

<p>But this time Ludwig had a better view of the
Englishman's face.</p>

<p>"<i>Potztausend!</i>" exclaimed the lawyer; "I shall
know that face. <i>Ach! lieber freund Fritz.</i> Can it be
really you? <i>Nein was f&uuml;r ein angenehme Ueberaschung!</i>"
he cried, rushing forward and throwing the
door wide open while he kissed his friend forcibly on
both cheeks.</p>

<p>"Sit down here and tell me to what for a fortuitous
and never-to-be-expected train of circumstances I am
indebted for this friendly and to me most agreeable
and blissful-past-days-recalling visit."</p>

<p>Fritz then went on to relate the circumstances of his
relative's death, and how he had been called from home
to attend him in his last moments.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for the death of your relation," said
Ludwig, "but I cannot sufficiently express my extreme
joy at seeing my old friend Fritz again after so many
years! Ha! ha! ha!" he laughed, partly from delight
at meeting his friend, and partly at his friend's mode of
introducing himself.</p>

<p>"What for an eccentric and of you and your strange
countryman-characteristic way of saluting your old
friend after so long!"</p>

<p>And the German again laughed again heartily.</p>

<p>"And what for a busy and for-ever-with-documents-and-papers-occupied
German business man, not even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to notice his swiftly entering, and though long departed
from German soil, speedily-vanishing and almost-forgotten
English friend!" retorted Fritz, mimicking the
high-flown, wordy phraseology of the German.</p>

<p>"No, on my honour, Fritz," replied his friend;
"not forgotten, I assure you. Do you know that I
had a dream of you only last night. It never struck
me till now. It is strange that I should have dreamed
of you just the night before your unexpected and to me
most grateful arrival. How strange it is that our dreams
often prognosticate coming events! It is as if the
mind, partly freed from its material covering during
sleep, received the power of peering with greater
accuracy into that to-us-in-our-waking-state-obscure and
unfathomable future which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Precisely; I understand you," answered my
relative, cutting short his friend's philosophic remark;
"but let us talk a little over old times; that is if you
are at leisure."</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure," answered the lawyer; "what I am
doing now has no need of hurry. Oh, by the way,
Fritz, talking of old times, do you remember the night
you spent at the house of old Franz Wenzel the Scharfrichter?"</p>

<p>"If I remember? Shall I ever forget it? ask,
rather," answered my ancestor.
"It seems to me only yesterday that I witnessed
that execution; and then that Poltergeist&mdash;it seems as if
I had witnessed his pranks only last night. I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
remember the minutest incident that happened on that
unhallowed evening."</p>

<p>"Well," resumed the lawyer, "poor old Franz is no
more."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;dead, eh?"</p>

<p>"Ay, murdered. Horrible to relate, his body was
discovered minus the head, which has been carried off
or hidden somewhere, for it hasn't been found yet, but
his son recognised the body by the clothes, besides
Franz has never returned home since, so it must be he.
There appears to be a mystery about it, however. The
murderer has not as yet been discovered, neither can
people guess at what prompted the murderer to take
the life of a man who was never over-burdened with
money. Then the head being cut off without care
being taken to bury the body, and all, too, within a
few steps of the Henker's own house. What could
have been the murderer's object in carrying off the
head?"</p>

<p>"A mere act of spite, I suppose," replied the
Englishman.</p>

<p>"Well, it may be so," replied his friend, "for it
seems that his life had been often threatened by the
friends or relations of those he had beheaded. It may
be as you say, out of spite. The murderer may, by way
of wreaking his vengeance have cut off the head of the
man who had put some friend or relation to death as a
trophy, but why just at this moment? Why not before,
as there has been no execution in the town lately? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
believe there has been none since that execution we
two witnessed together. If the avenger had made up
his mind to avenge his friend, why did he not do so
at once, instead of waiting these twelve years?"</p>

<p>"It may be some other private quarrel," replied
Fritz. "Are you mixed up in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall be at the trial."</p>

<p>"It happened recently it would seem."</p>

<p>"Only two days ago."</p>

<p>"Then the body is still fresh&mdash;of course it has been
exposed and examined?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it was recognised at once by the family.
I dare say it is buried by this time. I am going there
to-morrow. If you have time, my friend, I should be
most glad of your company."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind giving you a day or so, as I am
taking a holiday."</p>

<p>"Agreed, then; we start to-morrow."</p>

<p>The two friends then discoursed until dinner-time,
when Ludwig invited Fritz to share his meal.</p>

<p>The Englishman accepted the offer, and they chatted
and laughed the time away till the evening.</p>

<p>Ludwig lived quite alone. His sisters had married,
his mother was dead. Ludwig was still a bachelor, and
so was my ancestor at this time.</p>

<p>"You have not yet put your neck under the yoke it
appears," said my relative to his friend, in allusion to the
conjugal tie.</p>

<p>"Not I," replied his friend. "At least, not yet."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"I understand," said Fritz; "not married, but
'<i>verlobt</i>'."</p>

<p>"No, nor that either."</p>

<p>"No? <i>Verliebt</i>, then, perhaps."</p>

<p>"No, neither '<i>verlobt</i>' nor '<i>verliebt</i>'."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the Englishman, "not even
that! Nevertheless, if I remember rightly, the student
Ludwig Engstein was not once averse to the fair sex."</p>

<p>"Oh, recall not the follies of the past, my friend, or
I may retaliate," answered the German.</p>

<p>"True, true," said the Englishman. "We all have
our weaknesses, and youth is the season in which they
mostly flourish, but now we have both grown into sober-minded
<i>Philister</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and are more wary."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," rejoined his friend; "we are not to be
caught now by a pair of blue eyes, flaxen tresses, and a
jimp waist, however well these charms may be set off
with the allurements of dress. When men get to our
advanced age, they want 'geist,' and look out for a
good housewife who can cook them a dish of 'sauer
kraut' or a 'pfankuchen' when '<i>das moos</i>'<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is wanting,
which is another very useful accessory we desire to
have thrown in."</p>

<p>Here he made a significant gesture with his
finger and thumb, intended to express the counting of
money.</p>

<p>"I hope, my friend, you have not become so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
worldly as to look upon marriage in the light of bettering
yourself," said my relative.</p>

<p>"<i>Ach! lieber freund</i>," replied Ludwig. "It is all
very well for you rich milords who have '<i>l&ouml;wen</i>'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to
talk in that style, but we '<i>armer teufeln</i>' are bound to
take even that into consideration."</p>

<p>"This is what the world makes of noble fellows
when it has once got them in its grasp!" sighed my
ancestor to himself, and he hastened to change the conversation.</p>

<p>They then discoursed on various other topics,
sitting up to a late hour of night, until wearied with incessant
talking, each retired to rest.</p>

<p>Early the next morning both were dressed and
ready to start on their journey. They reached &mdash;&mdash;dorf
towards evening, and having fixed their
quarters at the very same inn they had put up at on
their memorable tour, they beguiled the time until the
morrow by discoursing with the townspeople about the
mysterious murder.</p>

<p>The body, it seems, was not yet underground, but
was to be buried the next day. They accordingly both
resolved to examine it.</p>

<p>"The head has not been found yet?" asked Ludwig
after supper of the landlord of the inn, who had come
in for a gossip.</p>

<p>"No, sir, not yet," replied their host. "Ah, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
are some strange rumours in the town about that same
murder."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" cried Fritz; "what do the people
say?"</p>

<p>"Some say one thing, and some another, but all
seem to agree that there is something supernatural
about the murder of the Henker."</p>

<p>"Something supernatural! Why&mdash;what reason have
they to jump at that conclusion?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I don't know if you have ever heard of
the Henker's Poltergeist, but it is a fact well known to
all in the township."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;even we know it. In fact&mdash;&mdash;but never
mind, proceed."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, this Poltergeist&mdash;this evil spirit&mdash;that
no doubt was permitted to haunt the headsman for
his sins&mdash;for a headsman must of necessity be a cruel,
hard-hearted, unnatural villain to choose such a profession."</p>

<p>"Well, well&mdash;this evil spirit."</p>

<p>"Well then the Scharfrichter, at least, so people
say, had sold his soul to this demon, and when the time
came round for him to give up his soul according to the
bargain, he refused, and the demon wrested it from him
by force by cutting off his head and carrying it away with
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, but why this strange supposition? Why put
down a thing to supernatural agency before sufficient
time has elapsed to investigate the matter properly? A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
person is murdered, and the body discovered without
the head, and because the head cannot be found at
once, you say that the devil has run off with it. My
dear sir, the thing's absurd."</p>

<p>"Well, we must wait and see what evidence will
turn up," said the host.</p>

<p>"Yes, but if everybody merely <i>waits</i> for evidence to
turn up instead of actively searching for it, the matter
will come to a standstill," said the Englishman. "I
myself am interested in the murder, as I knew the
Scharfrichter twelve years ago, when I was a student."</p>

<p>"Ah, in that case, sir&mdash;of course you would. By-the-by,
there is another murder now talked about besides
the Henker's. They seem to be getting in
fashion."</p>

<p>"What! another body?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, the body isn't exactly found yet, but
there is a certain Count, well-known to be rich, who was
taking a foot tour through the country alone. His
family expected him home on a certain day, and as he
hasn't turned up yet, they suspect that he has been
robbed and murdered."</p>

<p>"That may be merely a suspicion. How long has
he been missing?"</p>

<p>"Three days, they say."</p>

<p>"Three days! Why, a man doesn't bind himself to
a day or two when out on a foot tour. He may remain
another three days, or a week longer, and then return
unhurt."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, sir, it may be as you say, but as the Count
was known by his relations to be a very punctual man,
and never to fail in his appointments, you see, it is
natural they should feel uneasy."</p>

<p>"True, especially as three days ago was about the
time of the other murder, and they may get it into their
heads that the two murders occurred in the same night.
Was he a married man?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; quite young, they say."</p>

<p>"Humph! When did you say the body of the
Henker would be buried&mdash;to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"About ten, I think, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! then I must be there early, as I want to
examine the corpse myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, decidedly, sir. I will bring you to the place
to-morrow in good time."</p>

<p>Our friends now felt inclined for their night's rest,
so their host showed them into a room with two beds,
and wishing them a good night, left them to undress, and
before many minutes had passed both were sound asleep.</p>

<p>The following morning early our two friends, in the
company of their host, started from the inn to visit the
corpse of the murdered executioner. As they entered
the hall where the body lay exposed, Fritz instantly
recognised the clothes; if not the identical vestments
worn by the defunct twelve years ago, at least, of the
same colour and material, being, as I have said before, a
doublet and hose of crimson, a colour that he seems
to have been partial to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Fritz; "these are the Henker's clothes,
I've no doubt."</p>

<p>Then, after examining the form laid out before him,
he was observed to start slightly, and he added in a
whisper to his friend: "Ludwig, this is not the body of
Franz Wenzel&mdash;I'll take my oath of that."</p>

<p>"How! Not Franz Wenzel! Who else should it
be, then?"</p>

<p>"That I am not prepared to say, but it is not the
body of the Henker; that is certain. Remember that
I passed a night at Wenzel's house; during that time
I took note of the features and figure of the Scharfrichter,
and though twelve years have passed since I
saw him, I can swear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how! His own family have recognised him.
What further proof would you have?"</p>

<p>Then addressing the landlord, Ludwig said: "Is it
true, landlord, that his own family have recognised the
body?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; at least, the son did. I don't know
whether his wife did or not, as she has been laid up for
ever so long with paralysis, poor soul. It may be she
has never been informed of the murder. One does not
like to frighten invalids, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, well&mdash;enough if the corpse has been recognised
by the son."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, he recognised it. It is true, he was a
little the worse for liquor when they brought him before
the corpse of his father; but when is he otherwise, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the matter of that? As sad a young dog as ever lived that
same&mdash;inherits all the vices of his father. Nevertheless,
who is there in the township that does not recognise the
Henker's red legs?"</p>

<p>"You see, therefore, my friend," said Ludwig,
turning to his companion, "that you are mistaken.
Everybody recognises him."</p>

<p>"I see nothing of the sort," replied the Englishman,
doggedly; "and I am still prepared to swear that the
corpse before us is not that of Franz Wenzel."</p>

<p>"My dear Fritz," said Engstein, "you are obstinate.
What reason can you possibly have for saying so?"</p>

<p>"Observe the hands of the corpse," said Fritz, in a
low tone. "Do they look like the hands of an
executioner? They are long and delicate. Those of
Franz Wenzel were hard, rough, and hairy, with square
stunted fingers; besides, the headsman wore no ring.
This hand, though no ring is visible, has a depression
on the forefinger, as if the owner were in the constant
habit of wearing one."</p>

<p>"Ha! say you so?" exclaimed his friend, and a
strange expression came over his face.</p>

<p>"Then," pursued Fritz, "observe the clothes. Do
they look as if they were made for the body? Franz
Wenzel had enormously developed calves, and his hose
fitted tightly. Do these hose fit tightly? Look at
these limbs, that, compared with the Henker's, are but
those of a boy."</p>

<p>"Humph! I believe you are right, Fritz, after all,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
said Engstein; "but it never would have struck me if
you had not pointed it out, as it is so long ago since I
set eyes upon him, and then only for a moment. You
took a more complete survey of him, and your evidence
may prove useful. We will look into the matter together.
It is strange, however, that no one should
have been struck in the same manner as yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," responded Fritz. "The
people in these small villages are not always of the
brightest. Then the headsman's house being so far
away from the town, few people have the opportunity of
taking a minute survey of him. The people here content
themselves with recognising the clothes. Franz's
wife is laid up with paralysis, and has not seen the body,
while his son only recognised it when in a drunken
state. Do you call that sufficient evidence to prove
that the corpse before us is that of the executioner?
Would you like another proof that this is no more Franz
Wenzel than I am?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Ludwig.</p>

<p>"I remember a scar upon the right wrist that he
showed me the night I put up at his house," said the
Englishman; "and which he told me had been inflicted
on him by a piece of broken plate hurled at him
by his Poltergeist. I remember that he said he should
carry that mark with him to the grave. If this is the
corpse of Franz Wenzel we shall not fail to discover the
mark."</p>

<p>So saying, he bared the right arm of the corpse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
examined it carefully. No such mark was to be found.
The arm was free from scar or brand, and was delicate
in form, almost like that of a maiden's. Moreover,
there was a scanty covering of dark hair upon it, while
the hair on the arms of the executioner, if you remember
rightly, was red and profuse. Even Engstein
remarked this, and was now convinced beyond a doubt
that the murdered man was not Franz Wenzel.</p>

<p>"Is any search being made now for the head of
the corpse?" demanded Engstein of his host, who had
withdrawn some paces from the two friends, and consequently
had not heard the doubt that had been
suddenly cast upon the public opinion.</p>

<p>"No active search, I believe, sir," was the reply.</p>

<p>"We will make the search ourselves, my friend,"
whispered Engstein to Fritz; then added to his host,
"My friend and I will take a stroll together. It is
uncertain when we shall return to the inn, but get
something savoury for us against we come back," and
he waved his hand towards his host, who doffed his
cap and walked towards his inn, while our two friends
set off together in the direction of the Henker's house,
which they reached in about an hour.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fritz, "this is the place. I remember
it well. What did our host tell us? That the murder
took place only a few paces from the headsman's door.
Let us look well round the spot. How solitary it is!
Just the place where a murder would be committed.
What do you say to yon hollow flanked with brushwood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Ludwig? Is it not a likely place for a murderer to
await his victim?"</p>

<p>"You are right, Fritz, let us make a strict search,
but if the head has been carried far distant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let us, nevertheless, search well here first," said
my ancestor, and the two friends set to work at once,
lifting up every bush and bramble, following every track,
until finally they came upon some blood stains.</p>

<p>An old dried well they discovered not far from this
spot. Common sense would have suggested this as a
likely place for the concealment of the missing head,
and there is no doubt that the same idea struck the
inhabitants of &mdash;&mdash;dorf, for there was evident traces of
a great number of feet in the sand round about it;
besides which there was a chip recently made in the
brickwork, which appeared caused by the letting down
of a rope or chain.</p>

<p>This seemed evidence enough for our two friends
that the well had already been searched, and without
effect. Further search in that direction appeared to
them to be useless, especially as no bloodstains were to
be found near.</p>

<p>They then proceeded to examine more closely than
ever the bushes around, stamping on the ground to
ascertain if a hole had recently been made, but the ground
was firm, and there was nothing to attract suspicion
save a few bloodstains, which, instead of leading up
to the well as one would have imagined, led up to the
foot of an old chestnut-tree, and there seemed to end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>On examining the bark of the tree attentively they
observed blood also on the trunk, but this might have
been occasioned by the splashing of the blood from the
neck after the decapitation of the head. There was no
hollow visible in the tree where suspicion would lead
one to suppose that the head could be concealed; nevertheless,
when men make up their minds to make a rigid
search, they often pry into the most unlikely and impossible
places, so our friends determined to ascend the
tree to ascertain if by any chance the head could have
lodged between its leafy branches.</p>

<p>Previous to mounting, Ludwig, who, together with
his friend, had provided himself with a long branch
wherewith to beat down the bushes, struck the chestnut-tree
a blow on the trunk with the branch he carried,
when a hollow sound proceeded from the tree, and
instantly a large owl fluttered out from the foliage before
their faces with its beak and plumage stained with
blood. Blinded with the sunlight, it hovered distractedly
hither and thither for a time, and then vanished
with a screech.</p>

<p>"Did you notice the beak and feathers of the bird,
Ludwig?" asked Fritz.</p>

<p>"I did," said Ludwig, "and what is more, I am
convinced that the whole of this seemingly robust
chestnut-tree is hollow, and I have not a doubt that the
murderer, aware of the fact, has hidden the head of his
victim at the bottom, and that this fell bird has been
gorging itself and its young upon it ever since."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is just my opinion," said Fritz. "Let us
climb the tree and look within."</p>

<p>My ancestor was the first to mount, and having
arrived at the point where the trunk divides itself into
branches, he discovered a large hole thickly covered
over with leaves. Sitting upon the edge, with his legs
dangling within the hollow trunk, he proceeded to
strike a light, and having ignited a taper, he commenced
carefully to descend into the hollow of the tree. In his
descent, however, his foot slipped, his taper extinguished
itself, and he came down rather suddenly upon his feet.
He soon became aware from a feeble smothered shriek
that he was treading upon a nest of young owlets.</p>

<p>He began to dread lest he might encounter some
venemous reptile in this unexplored region, but taking
courage he struck another light and searched about. He
had not looked long when he discovered what appeared
to be a human scalp. He grasped it firmly by the hair,
and by the light of his taper soon knew it to be in
reality the head of a man, one half of which had been
already eaten away to the bone.</p>

<p>"Eureka!" exclaimed Fritz, "I have it."</p>

<p>His friend uttered an exclamation of delight, while
my relative clambered up again, and the two friends
examined the disgusting treasure under the fair light of
day.</p>

<p>"You see the hair is black," said Fritz. "I hope
you are satisfied now that this is not the head of the
Scharfrichter."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is no doubt about that now, I think," said
Ludwig. "And do you know, Fritz, now that I scan
these features, they seem familiar to me as my own in
the looking-glass. Himmel! Can it be possible!"</p>

<p>"What?" demanded my ancestor, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Why, I'll swear that this is no other than my old
friend and fellow-student, the Count of Waffenburg!"
exclaimed Engstein.</p>

<p>"What! Graf von Waffenburg! Is it really so? I
knew him well. Let me examine the features," said
Fritz.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is he beyond a doubt," said Ludwig. "We
had a quarrel once, and I wounded him in the cheek.
Here is the wound I myself inflicted; but afterwards we
became staunch friends."</p>

<p>"True," said Fritz. "I remember the duel well,
being present myself on the occasion. What a curious
coincidence! It is certainly he, and no other. The
more I look at the features the more satisfied I am.
Let us hasten with this proof of the identity of the
murdered man to the township and spread abroad the
news of the murder of the count. His relations will
then come to claim his body."</p>

<p>The two friends then made a covering of chestnut
leaves for the head, and tying it up in a handkerchief,
retraced their steps towards the township, discoursing
on the cunning of the murderer, who appeared to them
to be no other than the Scharfrichter himself.</p>

<p>"For when a body is found minus the head,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
argued Ludwig, "and dressed in the clothes of another
man, and that other man is nowhere to be found, it
follows as a matter of course that the man missing must
be the murderer."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Englishman, "unless the murdered
man had previously stolen the clothes of another, and
then afterwards been murdered by some unknown
assassin."</p>

<p>"But when the deceased has been proved beyond a
doubt to be the Graf von Waffenburg, a man whose
name is above so ridiculous a suspicion," said
Engstein.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course the blackest suspicion attaches
itself to Wenzel," said Fritz; "yet, in the case of a
mysterious murder, evidence, occasionally of so startling
and unexpected a nature, turns up as to completely alter
the state of the case.</p>

<p>"The headsman is missing, and a corpse has been
found dressed in his clothes. We presume, therefore,
that <i>he</i> is the murderer, but if after a time the Henker's
corpse should also be found&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, in that case," said Ludwig, "the aspect of
the whole affair would be changed. Well, we must
wait for further evidence. To-morrow the case will
begin in court, and my services will be required. I
doubt not before long that sufficient light will be thrown
on the subject to enable us to discover the true
murderer."</p>

<p>Thus our two friends chatted by the way, till in due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
time they arrived at the township, and having deposited
the head of the murdered man at the town hall, where
the body had been exposed, they spread abroad the
result of their expedition, and clearly proved to the
somewhat obtuse inhabitants their error.</p>

<p>On the following morning, then, the trial began. The
court was crowded to suffocation. Evidence of a very
extraordinary nature had turned up, so it was said, and
Ludwig Engstein, attired in his professional robes, was
preparing to conduct the case.</p>

<p>My ancestor was amongst the crowd, and had placed
himself as near as he possibly could to his friend.</p>

<p>"Call in Gottlieb Kr&auml;ger," cried the examiner.</p>

<p>A hoary peasant entered the witness-box, and the
examination proceeded in this wise:</p>

<p>"You are a farmer from the village of &mdash;&mdash;, are
you not?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Just inform us, if you please, what you were doing
on the night of the murder."</p>

<p>"I was returning home after selling some cattle at
the &mdash;&mdash;dorf market, and it was about midnight when I
passed close to the Henker's cottage. I heard cries and
groans as of someone being murdered not far off. I
stopped and listened for a moment, then set off on tip-toe
to the spot whence the sounds proceeded. It was
very dark, and the groans at length ceased.</p>

<p>"I placed myself behind some brushwood to watch
who should issue from the copse, when a friar passed me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stay, are you quite sure the friar came from the
very spot from whence you heard the groans?"</p>

<p>"Well, as to swearing to it, I don't know, but I
heard the sound as of brushwood being trampled under
foot, and the next instant the friar passed close to me.
He did not appear to observe me, but moved onward
in the direction of the village of Ahlden."</p>

<p>"Did you follow him or take any further notice of
him?"</p>

<p>"To say the truth, I was too frightened to move,
but I kept my eye on him as far as I could see him."</p>

<p>"But you tell me it was very dark."</p>

<p>"Just at that moment the moon had burst from behind
the clouds, and enabled me to see distinctly."</p>

<p>"Well, did you observe anything peculiar in the
manner or gait of the friar?"</p>

<p>"Yes; after he had passed me some ten paces he
halted, as if he were counting money, after which he threw
away something that glittered in the moonlight and then
walked on. I followed stealthily behind to discover what
it was that he had thrown away, when I picked up this."</p>

<p>The witness held up a long silk purse knitted with
silver beads.</p>

<p>"Give it to me&mdash;so&mdash;can you recollect anything
else about this friar? Could you manage to catch a
glimpse of his face?"</p>

<p>"No, I could not exactly distinguish the features,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"I observed a peculiar patch in his amice over the
left shoulder."</p>

<p>"Should you be able to swear to the amice?"</p>

<p>"Aye, that I should, among a thousand."</p>

<p>"Is this the amice of the friar you saw issue from
the copse?" asked Ludwig, holding up a patched
amice such as is worn by the Capuchin friars.</p>

<p>"The very same, I'll swear to it."</p>

<p>"Take care, you are on your oath."</p>

<p>"Well, if it is not the same, it is one made after
the same fashion, patch and all complete. I'll swear
to the shape of the patch, for I observed the garment
well."</p>

<p>"Enough; you may retire. Call in Hans Schultz."</p>

<p>A dapper little man with oiled hair and closely-shaven
face entered the court, and having taken his
post at the witness-box, gave his evidence as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am by profession a barber. The morning after
the murder I was shaving an elderly gentleman in my
shop. I suggested that a little hair dye would improve
his personal appearance, and offered him a bottle. He
refused to buy it, so I placed it on a table behind me,
and continued to shave him. Whilst I was recommending
the hair dye to my customer I noticed a
Capuchin friar pass several times in front of my shop.
He appeared to be listening to our conversation.</p>

<p>"Shortly afterwards he entered the shop and begged
for alms for the convent. I gave him a kreuzer, and
after he had chatted a little he left the shop. I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
not see his face well, as he kept it covered with his
hood, but I remember that he had a red beard. He
had hardly left my shop when on looking on the table
behind me I found the bottle of hair dye gone. No
one else but the friar and my customer had entered the
shop since I laid the bottle down upon the table, yet I
could not suspect my customer of having stolen the
bottle, and I was much at a loss to conceive what a
Capuchin friar should want with hair dye.</p>

<p>"I concluded, therefore, that I must have been mistaken,
and must have laid the bottle down somewhere
else without thinking, so I thought no more of it.</p>

<p>"On the same day I was called to cut the hair of a
gentleman at the other end of the village, when I passed
a friar who appeared to be the same as he who not long
ago had entered my shop. I looked at him in the face,
but he had a black beard. I could have sworn it was
the same, for his amice was patched in a peculiar
manner on the shoulder, as was that of the first friar."</p>

<p>"Is this the amice that the friar wore?" asked
Engstein, holding up the patched garment.</p>

<p>"It is like it. I could all but swear to it."</p>

<p>"Did you address him when you met him, as you
thought, a second time?"</p>

<p>"I was about to do so, but he pulled out his beads,
and began counting them. Not liking to disturb him
in his devotions, I passed on, thinking that after all I
might have been deceived."</p>

<p>"That is sufficient, you may go."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The little barber left the court, and another witness
was called for.</p>

<p>"Your name?"</p>

<p>"Max Offenbrunnen."</p>

<p>"Profession?"</p>

<p>"I am host of the Bear Inn in the village of M&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Can you tell us anything that happened at your
inn within this last week?"</p>

<p>"Yes; three days after the murder a Capuchin friar
stopped at my inn and called for a tankard of beer.
He kept his hood down all the time, so that I could
not see his face, but I remember that he had a black
beard, and I also noticed that he had a patch in his
amice over one shoulder of rather an unusual form."</p>

<p>The patched garment was held up again in court,
and recognised also by the third witness, after which he
proceeded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He called for more beer, and I began to enter into
conversation with him and asked him where he came
from. He told me from a Capuchin convent at W&mdash;&mdash;,
about a mile off. Just at that moment another friar, an
old friend of mine, passed my inn, who belonged to the
aforementioned convent.</p>

<p>"'Then you know each other,' said I to my friend
the second friar, and I sought to bring them together,
but my friend, after eyeing the former from head to
foot, denied all knowledge of him. The first friar then
somewhat confusedly stammered an excuse, saying
that he had spoken without thinking, but that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
intended to say St. Mary's, another Capuchin convent,
six miles further off. Then my friend the second friar
said that he knew all the friars at St. Mary's, but still
denied that he knew this one.</p>

<p>"The former began to mumble that he had only
lately arrived, and began to turn the conversation. My
friend whispered to me that he didn't believe he was a
friar at all, but someone in disguise. After my friend
had left, the former friar called for more beer (I never
saw a friar drink so much beer as this one), and being
curious to discover who the man was I tried to draw
him out. At first he answered cautiously, but after
drinking deeper he became less cautious and more confidential,
but his utterance was now thick and unintelligible.
He drew his chair closer to mine, and seemed
about to let me into some secret, when some other customers
of mine at the next table began to talk about the
murder.</p>

<p>"I noticed that the would-be friar started, and instead
of continuing his conversation with me, got up suddenly
and muttered some excuse for taking his departure. He
paid me hurriedly by lying down a Reichsgulden, saying
that whatever change there might be I might keep for
myself. He had hardly left my house when certain of
the guard who had been on the track of the
murderer stopped to question him, and finding he
could give no satisfactory account of himself, took him
into custody."</p>

<p>Other witnesses were then examined in their turn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
among which were certain members of the family of the
murdered count, and a certain Fraulein von Berlichingen,
his affianced bride, all of whom recognised the
body to be that of the missing Graf von Waffenburg.
The silken purse with silver beads picked up by the
first witness was also recognised by Fraulein von
Berlichingen as having been knitted by herself and
presented by her to her lover.</p>

<p>The remains of the murdered count were decently
interred. The melancholy event caused no small
commotion in the neighbourhood. The funeral was
followed by a large crowd of relatives and intimate
friends, among which were our two heroes Fritz and
Ludwig. The grief of Fraulein von Berlichingen was
too great to allow her to appear at the funeral. She
was inconsolable, and shortly afterwards entered a
convent.</p>

<p>But to return to the trial.</p>

<p>The prisoner was now conducted into court. He
was a man somewhat passed middle-age, though his
frame was square built and powerful, and his hair, beard,
and eyebrows were of a deep black, yet an observer
might have noticed that whenever a ray of sunlight
entered the court and shone full in the face of the
prisoner that his hair and beard turned to a glowing
purple, demonstrating beyond a doubt the presence of
dye. Those who chanced to be stationed near the
prisoner declared afterwards that the hairs of his head
towards the roots were of a bright red, and many were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
they who recognised, in spite of this disguise, the person
of Franz Wenzel, the executioner.</p>

<p>The prisoner, however, when examined, gave his
name as Adolf Schmidt, and denied stoutly that he was
Franz Wenzel, or to having ever had dealings with such
a person.</p>

<p>He denied having stolen a bottle of hair dye for the
purpose of disguising himself, and maintained that he
was an honest citizen who had donned a holy garb for
penitence, which had been imposed upon him by his
father confessor.</p>

<p>The prisoner was then asked if such were the case,
why he had tried to deceive the host of the Bear Inn
and the Capuchin friar when they asked him whence he
came. To this the prisoner replied that he loved not
to gratify the idle curiosity of others respecting his
private affairs. Ludwig Engstein then asked the
prisoner how he came in possession of the friar's
amice, for which he responded that it had been lent
him some time ago by his father confessor, who had
obtained it from some Capuchin friar of his acquaintance.</p>

<p>When asked for particulars concerning his father
confessor, he replied vaguely and confusedly, and when
begged to be more explicit, he refused, saying he had
private reasons for not divulging the affairs of his
friends.</p>

<p>Other witnesses were then called for, who stated
that they had been robbed of money and various sorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of ware more than once within the last three years,
about half a (German) mile from the house of the Scharfrichter
by a man who wore a mask, and who corresponded in height
and width of person to the prisoner.
Among these latter was a Jew pedlar, who three years
ago had been robbed of a large sum and various articles
of clothing, among which he declared was the identical
friar's amice held up in court, and which he perfectly
remembered to have patched himself.</p>

<p>This and such like evidence naturally went very
much against the prisoner; neither will it be wondered
at that his disguise was easily seen through, and his
person recognised as that of Franz Wenzel, the executioner.
He was consequently found guilty of wilful
murder and finally condemned to be beheaded. The
day of the execution was fixed, and the prisoner conducted
to the condemned cell.</p>

<p>We have mentioned before in an early part of this
story that the profession of the headsman was hereditary,
that the law forced the son of an executioner to follow
in the steps of his father.</p>

<p>The unhappy wretch then, according to this law, was
doomed to lose his life at the hands of his own son.
Much speculation, however, among the inhabitants of &mdash;&mdash;dorf
had arisen as to whether the law would
actually enforce so rigorous a decree, and whether the
son of the Scharfrichter would rebel against it if it did,
or bow submissively to so harsh and unfeeling an order.</p>

<p>Some there were who thought that an exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
ought to be made in this case, and a new Henker
selected, as it was hard for the son to suffer for the
crimes of the father; but even if the law were disposed
to be lenient, who was the new aspirant to be? Who
would like to come forward to offer his services?</p>

<p>The office of the Scharfrichter was in such bad
odour that it would be difficult to find a man in the
whole village who could be persuaded to undertake the
task, even by the offer of a large reward.</p>

<p>However, after much speculation and gossip, the
inhabitants came to the conclusion that everything
might be done with money, and that someone would be
certainly found to accept the bribe.</p>

<p>Others began to spread throughout the village that
the man had already been found, and ventured to point
out such or such a citizen as the new practitioner.
Meanwhile the law had remained passive and had not
troubled itself to make an exception in the case, and
the burgomaster who had the superintendence of such
affairs was far too phlegmatic and indifferent even to
give the matter a thought.</p>

<p>He knew that an execution had to take place, that
someone would be paid for amputating the head of the
criminal, but whether it was to be one man's duty or
another's was all the same to him.</p>

<p>The headsman's trade was hereditary, and he (the
burgomaster) had never heard of any such innovation
as that of selecting a new headsman during the lifetime
of the rightful heir; therefore, as a matter of course, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
young Scharfrichter was to decapitate his own father,
and there was an end of the matter.</p>

<p>What to him were the feelings of the son at being
forced to obey so unnatural a dictate? He was paid
for it like anyone else, and very good pay he got, too.</p>

<p>What to him was the additional anguish of the
criminal at being executed by his own son? He knew
well enough that his son would step into his shoes when
he himself should be deprived of office, and if he didn't
like to lose his head at the hands of his own son, he
ought to have reflected before he committed the
murder.</p>

<p>Now, the burgomaster had a confidential servant,
one Heinrich G&ouml;bel, a man of heartless and revengeful
nature, who cherished an ill-will against the prisoner's
son for having dared to supplant him in the affections
of a certain blue-eyed damsel, the daughter of a tavern-keeper
in the village.</p>

<p>The father of the lady in question was not over
pleased with the attentions of either of these individuals
towards his Lieschen, one of the aspirants for his
daughter's hand being a drunkard, the son of an executioner,
who besides the stigma inevitably attached to
his character for life, would be obliged to maintain his
daughter by the scanty proceeds of his loathsome profession.</p>

<p>The other, a man of notoriously bad character, and
dependent upon the wages he received from his master
for a living. Of the two, the maid herself decidedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
favoured Leo Wenzel, the young headsman, and seeing
this, Heinrich G&ouml;bel inwardly resolved to take vengeance
on his rival upon the first opportunity.</p>

<p>Whilst plotting vengeance thus in his heart, G&ouml;bel
sought his master and shaped his conversation in this
wise:</p>

<p>"Herr B&uuml;rgermeister, this will be a somewhat
difficult business, this execution."</p>

<p>"How so?" inquired his master.</p>

<p>"Why, according to law," answered his servant,
"young Leo will have to take the life of his own father."</p>

<p>"Well, what of that?" said the burgomaster.</p>

<p>"They say he is a young man of spirit, and he
might refuse to take his father's life."</p>

<p>"Refuse! would he? The law will force him."</p>

<p>"But if he is obstinate and persists? He is a
young man of spirit."</p>

<p>"Ugh! I hate these young men of spirit, they are
always making trouble and subverting order. Well,
if he makes a disturbance, he will be imprisoned,
that's all."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course; but for all that, if he positively
refuses to lift his arm against his father, the law
cannot force him to do it."</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly, but&mdash;but what has put it into
your head that he <i>will</i> refuse? He will be rewarded
for his services."</p>

<p>"But if he could not be tempted by a reward, if by
chance he should refuse at the last moment to act the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
part of executioner towards his own father, and no one
should be found to accept the post&mdash;why, in that case,
if <i>my</i> services should be accepted, I should be most
glad to officiate."</p>

<p>"What, <i>you</i>, Heinrich! <i>you</i> turn Scharfrichter! Ha!
ha!&mdash;this is something quite new. I was not aware
that that was anything in your line."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, knowing your dislike to a disturbance
among the populace (a thing very likely to occur if the
headsman should not be found at his post)&mdash;rather than
such an old vagabond as Franz Wenzel should get off in
the confusion, why, I'll undertake the job myself."</p>

<p>"You would? Ha! ha!&mdash;but stay, if there <i>should</i>
be a disturbance (which Heaven forfend, as any excitement
sadly upsets my digestion), I am not so sure that
I should like my servant to take upon himself the office
of Scharfrichter, for the odium of the populace that he
would naturally incur would reflect likewise upon his
master, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if you fear that, I should then advise
another line of conduct."</p>

<p>"Indeed! What may that be?"</p>

<p>"To keep young Leo in ignorance that it is his
father that he is called upon to execute. Listen to me!
The Scharfrichter's house is a mile distant; our villagers
have a superstitious dread of the spot, and are not likely
yet to have communicated with the young man, and I
know that he hasn't been in the township since he was
last called to swear to the identity of the murdered man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
then commonly believed to be his father. You will
recollect that he identified the corpse as that of his
father. In his lonely dwelling, he can have heard
nothing of the trial, and is consequently still under the
impression that it is his father that has been murdered.</p>

<p>"Now, if you will leave the matter to me I will contrive
that he shall not be undeceived until too late."</p>

<p>"Yes; but how?"</p>

<p>"First of all I will go there myself with the news that
the murderer of his father has been arrested, that the
day has been fixed for his execution, and that he will
have the pleasure of trying his hand for the first time in
his life on his father's murderer. Everything will go
straight, provided he has as yet heard nothing from
other tongues."</p>

<p>"But if he has?"</p>

<p>"Then our plan is frustrated; but I go to ascertain
that, and if he has not, the greatest care must be taken
that no one communicates with him from this town, to
which end you should give orders for the gates of the
town to be closed for some days, under the excuse that
you have been robbed of certain valuables, and have
taken this precaution to catch the thief. It would
be as well, perhaps, to hurry on the execution as quickly
as possible."</p>

<p>"Well, but there is one point I don't understand.
Supposing all to go on smoothly, as you seem so confident
that it will, won't the young man recognise his
father when led up to the scaffold in the 'poor sinner's'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
cart, and afterwards takes his seat on the chair placed
for him?"</p>

<p>"There is our great difficulty, but let us hope for
the best. The prisoner, as you know, took the precaution
to dye his red head black in order to escape
recognition. This will aid our project. The 'poor
sinner's' garb that he will don the morning of the execution
will also help the disguise. Young Leo is but a
superficial observer, and before he has well taken note
of the criminal his head will be off."</p>

<p>"You are very hopeful as to the success of your
scheme, but if the father, in his last moments, makes
himself known to his son&mdash;should rush into his arms to
embrace him and say: 'My son, do you not know
me? I am your father&mdash;you will not have the heart to
execute your own father, the author of your existence.'"</p>

<p>"We must prevent this. Let a handkerchief be tied
round his jaw that he cannot open his mouth to speak.
This, after all, will be nothing more than is usually done
to catch hold of the head in order to exhibit it to the
public after decapitation, the only difference being that
it is generally tied on after the criminal has taken his
seat on the scaffold, while in this case it will be done
before. Another bandage should be bound round his
eyes at the same time, which is also customary; thus
a great portion of the prisoner's face will be hidden.
His arms will be pinioned firmly to his sides, so as to
render all attempt at the removal of the bandage
impossible, and everything will pass off quietly."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well, you're a queer dog. See that it <i>does</i>
pass off quietly, that's all, and don't bother me any
more about it. Mind, I leave the matter entirely in
your hands."</p>

<p>"Never fear, sir, I am off at once to the house of
the Scharfrichter; trust everything to me. Stay, you had
better issue an order for the gates of the town to be
closed at once. You can give me a pass before I start,
or they will shut me out with the rest."</p>

<p>"True; just wait one moment. Here&mdash;the pen and
ink&mdash;so now be off as fast as you can."</p>

<p>Off started the servant of the burgomaster with the
order to the gatekeeper to close the gates, and the pass
which was to admit none but himself, and after the
gatekeeper had received the necessary instructions,
Heinrich passed rapidly through the gates and directed
his steps towards the house of the Scharfrichter. He
chuckled to himself as he contemplated the success of
his scheme.</p>

<p>"What would the death of his father at my hands be
to him to the discovery of having taken his father's life
himself! That will be revenge indeed! Now to the
fulfilment of my scheme there is no obstacle."</p>

<p>He had proceeded about an English mile on his way
when, suddenly lifting his eyes, he descried in the distance
the figure of an aged man, who appeared to be
going the same road as himself. He hastened his steps,
and soon overtook the veteran, whom he now recognised
as one of his fellow citizens, a certain Gustav Meyer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and known to be one of the greatest gossips in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Gustav," said G&ouml;bel, with forced good
humour. "Where are you off to on those venerable
pins of yours?"</p>

<p>"Ach! lieber, freund G&ouml;bel!" exclaimed the loquacious
old man; "how are you? I have not seen you
for an age. You have grown proud since you have been
in the burgomaster's service, and forget that it was I
who got you the situation, for you never come to see
me now, though we used to be such cronies, you know.
But you young folks never think it worth while to give
us old fogies a call to see how we are. Why, I might
be dead and buried for all you would know about it,
and even if you did hear of it, I suppose it would be all
the same to you, eh?</p>

<p>"Well, well, 'ingratitude is the reward of the world,'
as the proverb says, and we old fogies with one foot in
the grave and the other about to follow must make up
our minds to be put on the shelf. We all have our
turn; I have had mine, you are having yours, but old
age comes at last, and then there is an end of us all,
even to the best of us. Even I have been young, friend
G&ouml;bel. Ha! ha! You'd hardly think so to look at me
now with these silvery locks and tottering limbs. I say
you'd hardly think so now, would you, eh? Now, how
many years should you think I could count, friend
G&ouml;bel, tell me?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest idea," said G&ouml;bel, impatiently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am hard upon ninety years old, and all tell me
that I carry my years well. I may say I haven't had a
day's illness in all my life. I have nearly all my teeth
yet, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt all you say is very true, my
friend," interrupted G&ouml;bel; "but you have hardly
answered my question satisfactorily yet. I asked you
where you were going?"</p>

<p>"Friend G&ouml;bel," said the old man, "now I'll just
tell you what I propose doing this morning, just by way
of stretching my old limbs, seeing that I have not had a
walk for an age. It does old folks good to go out for
a stroll every now and then in the country. Too much
staying at home over the fire isn't good, even for the
likes of me."</p>

<p>"Well, well," broke in G&ouml;bel, beginning to lose all
patience. "I asked you where you were going."</p>

<p>"Did you? Ah yes, I had nearly forgot. We old
folks are apt to lose our memories at times, you know,
my friend, so you young folks ought to have compassion
on us, and recollect that we were once like you, and
that you will one day become like us, therefore&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is insufferable," burst out G&ouml;bel, whose forbearance
was quite at an end. "I ask you a plain
question, and I expect a plain answer. I repeat the
question&mdash;Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Hoity, toity! friend G&ouml;bel," cried the old man, in
great surprise. "What! so impatient with your old friend
Gustav! Don't you remember how often I have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
you upon my knee and danced you? We used to be
great friends then. Don't you recollect? But I suppose
you have forgotten all that now, eh?&mdash;since you have
become a man. Let me see, how long ago must that
be? Full thirty years ago, if it's a day, I'll warrant."</p>

<p>"Will you, or will you not, give me a plain answer to
a plain question. Tell me where you are going?" cried
G&ouml;bel, now quite furious, and shaking the old man
violently by both shoulders.</p>

<p>"Softly, softly! friend G&ouml;bel," cried the veteran,
much alarmed. "Save my life. Prithee, save my life,
and I will tell you where I am going, if you will have
patience."</p>

<p>"Well, tell me at once, and let us have no more
chattering," said G&ouml;bel, leaving go his hold.</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place, then," began old Gustav,
recovering himself&mdash;"in the first place&mdash;&mdash;but stay, upon
second thoughts, I'll just leave you to guess where I am
going. Now, where do you think?"</p>

<p>"Dotard, have a care!" cried G&ouml;bel, threateningly,
"and trifle with me no longer. Tell me where you are
going, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well, friend G&ouml;bel, I'll tell you; don't be
afraid, don't let two such old friends as we are quarrel
for a trifle&mdash;I'll tell you where I am going, although I
must say that I think you seem to take an uncommon
interest in the doings of an old man like me, who,
though he be an old friend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take care now!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well, my friend, wait one moment; I'll tell
you. I told you before that I would tell you, and I will
be as good as my word, if you will have one moment's
patience&mdash;for patience, friend G&ouml;bel, patience, I say, is
a virtue that we ought all to cultivate, and which we all
of us more or less are sadly wanting in. But to proceed;
though, after all, my friend, what hurry can you possibly
have to learn so simple a fact? It appears to me that
the world has grown wondrously impatient since my time;
that is, if everybody is like you, but as I said before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me! tell me!" screamed G&ouml;bel, seizing his
venerable friend a second time by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, then, my friend," said Gustav, drawing out his
words at a most provoking length, "if I <i>must</i> tell you,
and you are quite sure that you have sufficient patience
to listen to me, learn that I am going to pay a visit at
the house of the Scharfrichter, to have a quiet little gossip.
You know I am fond of a nice little gossip. Well, I am
just going to have a little chat with that poor young man
Leo Wenzel. What do you think? He doesn't know
yet that his father is the real murderer, for he lives so
far off and no one ever goes near the house to tell him
the news, and he is still under the delusion that his
father has been murdered and that the assassin has not
yet been caught. Poor young man, I shall have to
break the news very gently to him, for he will feel it
deeply. He must know the truth sooner or later, so I have
taken upon myself to be the first to communicate the
unwelcome news.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"According to the law he will be obliged to take the
life of his own father. It will be a dreadful blow to
him, poor boy, and I am sure I don't know how he will
be induced to act executioner in the present instance.
I know not if the law in this case will make an exception
and choose someone else in his place; it will be
very hard upon him if the law really should insist on
being carried out to the very letter. Let us hope that
mercy will be shown to the son, but in any case it is a
very dreadful affair, so I thought I would just go to
comfort him a little, to see how he takes the matter, and
give him courage, in case&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought as much!" muttered G&ouml;bel to himself;
then aloud to his friend, "So that is where you are
going is it? Ah, then I will save you the trouble.
Being a matter of no importance, you need not be in a
hurry. Listen to me; my master has lost certain
valuables, and has given orders for the gates of the town
to be closed until he has discovered the thief, and has
strictly commanded me to arrest any person I might
find leaving the town, until his valuables shall have been
recovered. I should be sorry to suspect you, but as the
law respects the person of no man, it is my painful duty
to take you back to the town. Let us have no more
cackling or resistance, but come at once."</p>

<p>"But, my dear friend G&ouml;bel!" pleaded the veteran,
"you surely can't suspect&mdash;you will not for one moment
imagine&mdash;nay, if you have any doubt of my honesty
search me. I can assure it will be useless, I am innocent."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you are innocent, you will be proved so in due
time, meanwhile I have orders&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, friend G&ouml;bel, I assure you again and again
upon my oath that I have taken nothing. There&mdash;look&mdash;search
me all over, if you will, and let me go in
peace. Is not my character enough? Am I not well
known in &mdash;&mdash;dorf? Have I ever been known to touch
my neighbour's goods? Pray satisfy yourself that I have
taken nothing, and let me go. Why trouble yourself to
bring back a man to the town to be searched whom you
know to be innocent. Besides, it will upset my plan. I
wouldn't miss my little gossip with young Leo for all
the world just at this moment. Just consider, my
friend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cease your cackling and come along with me!"
shouted G&ouml;bel, seizing him by the collar and dragging
him forcibly back towards the town.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;" stammered the astonished and
terrified old man.</p>

<p>"But me no buts, but do my bidding instantly, Sir
Driveller, or it will be the worse for you."</p>

<p>So saying, he dragged his old friend home again at a
hurried pace, regardless of his tottering limbs and of his
prayers and entreaties.</p>

<p>It was just mid day, and the sun shone hot, when
G&ouml;bel returned to the township, perspiring at every
pore, and deposited his charge, more dead than alive,
within the walls of &mdash;&mdash;dorf. He then retraced his steps
under the broiling sun, cursing and swearing as he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
at his plan having been so nearly frustrated by the
cackling gossip of an old dotard.</p>

<p>"<i>Potz&mdash;Himmel, Donnerwetter, Schock, Schwerer,
Noth, noch mal!</i>" he muttered to himself. "A pretty
obstacle in my path! <i>Tausend Teufel!</i> I had a mind
to dash his brains out on the spot, the old idiot, for his
drivelling."</p>

<p>With these and such like elaborately strung together
oaths the servant of the burgomaster beguiled the time,
until at length he arrived at the door of the Scharfrichter's
house, where he discovered young Leo at work in
his garden. The young executioner looked up at the
sound of stranger footsteps, and though he would rather
the visitor had been anyone else than his rival, yet upon
the whole he was not displeased to see a human face
after so long. His manner even warmed towards his
visitor when he saw him advance with a smile on his
face and an extended hand.</p>

<p>"Leo," began Heinrich G&ouml;bel with feigned friendship,
"we have long been enemies, but everything has
an end. I have now come to offer you my hand in
friendship, for henceforth we are no longer rivals, but
friends. Lieschen, think of her no more. Her father
positively refuses to give her to either of us, so she has
at length plighted her troth to another man."</p>

<p>"What! Lieschen? Impossible!" cried Leo, mopping
his forehead.</p>

<p>"Ay, my friend, it is too true; nay, pray calm yourself.
I, too, loved her as you did, but since the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
has turned out thus, I have made up my mind to console
myself by paying my addresses to another as soon
as possible."</p>

<p>"You never <i>could</i> have loved her as I loved her,"
gasped out Leo, as he staggered for support against the
garden wall.</p>

<p>"Well, well, my friend, I knew you would feel the
blow, but calm yourself and dismiss these gloomy
thoughts. I have better news than that in store for
you."</p>

<p>"What care I for news now that <i>she</i> has deserted
me?" groaned Leo distractedly.</p>

<p>"Come, come now, let me comfort you a little," said
G&ouml;bel. "What do you think? <i>The murderer of your
father has been discovered!</i>"</p>

<p>"What do I hear? Caught? Safe?"</p>

<p>"Ay, the murder has been proved, and the murderer
condemned to die by the sword. The execution has
been fixed for the day after to-morrow. It will take
place at daybreak as usual, and you will have the satisfaction
of taking vengeance on your father's murderer
with your own hands. You will wield your father's
sword for the first time in your life before an admiring
crowd. Think of that."</p>

<p>"Vengeance at last!" cried the young headsman,
with flushed face and distorted features. "Vengeance
at last! Thank God! thank God!"</p>

<p>"Bravo, old friend!" cried G&ouml;bel, slapping his
heartily detested rival on the shoulder in the friendliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
manner possible. "I knew you would take heart at
this piece of news. Come, let us sit down together and
console ourselves."</p>

<p>Leo, then entering the house, took from a cupboard
a large bottle of schnaps and two glasses.
The two companions, seating themselves, began
to drink deeply and to chat incessantly, the subject
of the discourse being the particulars of the murder
according to the version of G&ouml;bel. We need hardly say
that the whole was a fabrication of Heinrich's own
brain. At length the servant of the burgomaster rose
to take his departure, and having enjoined his rival to
be of good cheer, bent his steps again towards the township,
chuckling by the way at his own devices. Arrived
at the gates of the town, he showed his pass, and was
permitted to enter without let or hindrance. Hurrying
through the streets until he reached the burgomaster's
house, he presented himself before that worthy, whom
he found seated at a table before a plate of sausage, and
in the act of draining to the dregs an enormous tankard
of beer.</p>

<p>"Well, what news?" asked his master.</p>

<p>"Oh! the very best; he took the bait greedily. It
was quite a pleasure to see how he enjoyed the news.
No one had been before me, so I had him all to myself.
The matter will now go off as smoothly as could be
desired; but, by the saints! I had a narrow escape of
failure."</p>

<p>"Indeed! How was that?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"When I was nearly half way to the Scharfrichter's
house, who should I see just ahead of me but that
cursed old gossip, Gustav Meyer. I stopped him and
asked him where he was going. <i>Potztausend!</i> what a
chatterbox! I thought I should not get an answer out of
him before nightfall, and when I did, where do you
think he <i>was</i> going? Why, straight to the house of the
Henker to have a quiet chat with young Leo upon the
subject of the murder, and reveal to him all that I
had taken such pains to keep secret. He seemed
delighted at the idea of being the first to deliver the
news."</p>

<p>The burgomaster laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Well, what did you do?" said he, at length.</p>

<p>"What did I do! I told him his presence was particularly
wanted at the township, and seizing him by the
collar, dragged him all the way back again, regardless of
his cackling. I informed him that you had lost some
valuables, and had given me orders to arrest anyone
leaving the town on suspicion. He was indignant at
the charge. Protested, declared his innocence, and spoke
of the high character he had always borne in the town,
etc., etc. He seemed in despair at being deprived of
his little gossip with the Henker's son, and begged and
entreated me to let him have it out quietly; but, deaf to
all his chattering, I dragged him home again in spite of
himself, and lodged him safely within the gates of the
town. <i>Donner und Blitzen!</i> but it was enough to raise
the bile of a saint to listen to the wanderings of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
antique driveller, to say nothing of having one's plan so
nearly frustrated; by such a worm as that too!"</p>

<p>Here and again the burgomaster burst into a loud
laugh, in which G&ouml;bel, in spite of himself, joined.</p>

<p>"Ah," said he, at length recovering himself, "there
is one thing yet to be done. I must go to the jailor of
the prison with private orders from you to prevent the
prisoner having an interview with his son, should he
ask for one. This accomplished, there will be no more
difficulty."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said the burgomaster, "it would be as
well. But what an interest you seem to take in this
case, Heinrich! One would imagine that you had a
private grudge against the prisoner."</p>

<p>"I like to see things well done," was the reply, and
the servant shortly after left the presence of his master.</p>

<p>A great sensation was caused in &mdash;&mdash;dorf when it was
given out that the execution had been hurried on a
week, and much speculation arose as to what could have
been the burgomaster's motive. Half the town already
knew by the tongue of old Gustav of his having been
arrested by the servant of the burgomaster on suspicion
of having robbed his master of certain valuables just at
the very time when he (Gustav) was contemplating the
pleasure he would have in being the first to communicate
the melancholy tidings of the murder to the young
headsman. They therefore concluded that Leo must
still be in ignorance of the real state of the case. The
other half of &mdash;&mdash;dorf, however, never gave a thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
as to whether he knew it or not; enough for them that
someone was going to be beheaded and that they
should have a spectacle to vary the monotony of their
humdrum lives.</p>

<p>At length the fatal day arrived. The gates of the
town were thrown open (for the servant of the burgomaster
gave out that the thief had been discovered and
the valuables regained), and now all &mdash;&mdash;dorf was in an
uproar, while crowds of peasants from all the surrounding
villages flocked to witness the bloody spectacle.</p>

<p>The scaffold, or the mound of earth which was to
serve as such, had been erected half way between the
township and the house of the executioner, and was
already surrounded by a file of soldiers, around which
thronged the mob so closely that they were every now
and then repulsed by the military. From the sea of
human heads that inundated the place of execution resounded
a hum of voices, in which salutations, sallies,
bad language, coarse jokes, and coarser laughter,
together with murmurs and imprecations, and an occasional
scream from the women when the crowd pressed
too closely, were confusedly mingled, and resembled at a
little distance the bleating of an immense flock of sheep.
Classes of all sorts were jostled together, from the lowest
grade of handwerksbursch to the university student.
There were pretty peasant girls in their holiday costumes,
and sturdy peasants from all parts of the country. There
were Jew hawkers, sharpers, pickpockets, ruffianly bullies,
cripples, and mendicants. There were mothers with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
young children in their arms, which latter contributed
their feeble cries to the general buzz.</p>

<p>All had turned out to feast their eyes upon the death
of a fellow mortal. Nor was this an ordinary execution
like that described in an earlier part of this story. No;
this was an exceptional case&mdash;something out of the common
way, a sublimer spectacle.</p>

<p>In this case the condemned was no obscure handwerksbursch,
of whose career the multitude knew nothing,
and cared as little about. The criminal was no less
a man than Franz Wenzel, the far-famed Scharfrichter,
who had amputated the heads of "poor sinners" for
the last thirty or forty years, and was now doomed to
lose his own.</p>

<p>The interest in the case was considerably heightened
when it was known that the veteran executioner was to
be operated upon by the hands of his own son. Then
the facts of the murder were so strange, so unnatural.
Fancy the cunning of that hardened old sinner, the ex-headsman,
who, according to his own confession, made
in prison the day before the execution, had waylaid,
robbed, and murdered the innocent Count of Waffenburg,
a scion of one of the most wealthy and respected
noble families for miles round, disguised as a Capuchin
friar, and in order to conceal the identity of the murdered
man, had dissevered the head of the corpse,
which he had endeavoured to hide for ever from the eye
of man by throwing it into the trunk of a hollow chestnut
tree. Then having stripped the corpse of its clothes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and afterwards having stripped himself of his outer
garments, he dressed up the corpse of his victim in his
own well known crimson-coloured doublet and hose,
thereby conveying the idea to the public mind that the
corpse found was his own, after which, returning to his
house close by, having again donned the friar's habit, he
deposited the sword usually set apart for the beheading
of criminals, and in this case used for amputating the
head of the murdered count, and wiping it well, he lighted
a fire on his hearth where he burned one by one the
habiliments of his victim. He then left his house a
second time, still disguised as a friar and laden with his
ill-gotten treasure, passed once more the scene of the
murder and wandered all night in the direction of &mdash;&mdash;.
How strange the evidence, too, that convicted
him, the theft of the bottle of hair dye, the
remarkable patch on his amice. Every particular of the
murder had an indescribable interest in the minds of the
populace of &mdash;&mdash;dorf and its surrounding villages. No
wonder the adjacent townships vomited forth their scum
of the curious, idle, and depraved! This was a sight not
to be missed on any account, and would furnish them
with gossip for the next six months at least. At length,
when the long streaky rose-tipped clouds announced
the approach of the fatal hour, the crowd burst out
simultaneously into a cry of "He comes! he comes!
the Henker comes!"</p>

<p>The crowd made room for a young man in a cart,
who, having thrown the reins on the horse's neck, passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
through the file of soldiers and mounted the hillock of
earth, armed with the two-handed weapon that he was
about to use for the first time in his life.</p>

<p>"Look!" said one of the crowd; "it <i>is</i> young Leo,
after all. I thought they had found a substitute."</p>

<p>"What a hard-hearted young ruffian to consent to
take the life of his father with his own hands!" said
another.</p>

<p>"And he doesn't seem to feel it a bit," said a third;
"why, he is actually smiling."</p>

<p>"Some folks say that he does not know who it is
that he is going to behead," said a fourth.</p>

<p>"Not know that the criminal is his father?" exclaimed
the former speaker. "Nonsense, I don't believe it."</p>

<p>The young headsman was attired in a buff leather
jerkin slashed with red and hose of a dark green. He
appeared about two-and-twenty, and was as yet beardless.
He was considerably taller than his father, but
his frame, though powerfully built, was devoid of that
excessive and almost preternatural muscular development
that characterised that of the old executioner.
His hair was of a reddish brown, his complexion florid,
his eyes light blue, and his features, though somewhat
coarse, had something in them not altogether disagreeable.
He leaned firmly on his sword and gazed around
calmly on the crowd, when suddenly the human sea
became violently agitated and began to groan and hiss
in its fury.</p>

<p>The cause of this tumult became speedily known.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
It was the arrival of the "poor sinner," who was drawn
in a cart between two priests and habited according to
the custom of the condemned on such occasions. Loud
hooting and execrations burst forth on all sides from the
crowd as it made way for the condemned cart.</p>

<p>"But that is not Franz Wenzel," said one to his
neighbour. "The old Henker had red hair; this man's
hair is black."</p>

<p>"Fool, don't you know how that is?" said his
neighbour. "Haven't you heard yet how he dyed his
hair black in order not to be recognised?"</p>

<p>"No, did he though?" said the former. "But look!
why is his head tied up so with two handkerchiefs? I
can't see anything of his face."</p>

<p>"H'm, I don't know; some innovation I suppose.
The handkerchief always used to be tied on when on
the scaffold in my time," answered his friend. The
criminal had now alighted from the cart, and, followed by
the two priests, ascended the place of execution, where
he took his seat on the chair placed for him. The
assistant executioner, whose face was most successfully
disguised with a black mask, pushed his way through
the crowd and mounted the platform.</p>

<p>"Who is <i>he</i>?" was a question asked by everyone
of everybody; "and why is he masked while Leo, who
bears the sword, is unmasked?"</p>

<p>"Who knows? Perhaps he is the new headsman
that they all talked about, and young Leo will not really
behead his own father; but we shall see."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The crowd had grown more curious than ever. Every
one stood on the tip-toe of expectation with his eyes
and mouth wide open. An intense silence reigned
around, during which the man in the mask bound the
criminal firmly to his seat with a strong cord, then
seizing the handkerchief that was tied round the head
of the condemned, he gave the signal for the blow.
The two priests who had hitherto been whispering consolation
in the ear of the criminal now retreated a few
paces to the rear, while young Leo advanced, flushed
and triumphant, his whole countenance distorted with
an expression of malice and revenge. Before brandishing
his sword to give the final blow he lowered his head
close to the ear of the victim and hissed out in accents
sufficiently audible to be overheard by that part of the
crowd that had assembled nearest to the scaffold:
"Wretch! thine hour has come at last. Learn now the
vengeance of a wronged son. Thou shalt see if I am
the son of my father or no, and whether it is for nothing
that I have been bred a Scharfrichter. Prepare now,
for thou art soon to learn how I have profited by my
lessons&mdash;whether I am an apt pupil. My sword is
sharpened well on purpose for thee, and when thou
feelest the cold steel close to thy neck, then, then, to
h&mdash;&mdash;l with thee, and bear throughout eternity the curses
of a ruined son!"</p>

<p>During this speech of the young headsman the
criminal was observed to tremble convulsively, as if
struggling to speak, but the assistant executioner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
grasped the handkerchief still tighter round his head
and repeated the signals impatiently.</p>

<p>"Did you hear?" said one of the foremost in the
crowd. "Did you hear how he cursed his father? He
actually reproached him in his last moments for having
brought him up a Scharfrichter! Oh! the unfeeling
young villain! What a heart he must have."</p>

<p>"Ah! neighbour," answered another, "these executioners
are not like other mortals; they do not know what
it is to feel. They are brought up to kill their fellow
creatures as butchers are to kill cattle, and they think
nothing of it. Bless you, there is nothing these men
would not do for money."</p>

<p>"'Tis strange, too," said another close by. "I always
thought young Leo loved his father. I never thought
so bad of him as to think that he would curse him
in his dying moments, wretch though he may have
been."</p>

<p>"Take my word for it, neighbour," said a sturdy
inhabitant of &mdash;&mdash;dorf, "that young Leo does not know
yet that it is his father."</p>

<p>At this moment everyone suddenly broke short his
discourse, and the crowd again was silent for a moment.
The two-handed weapon was raised high in the air,
glittered for a moment in the rays of the rising sun,
then descended with the rapidity of lightning, while the
head of the murderer having slipped out of the handkerchief
with the force of the blow, fell with a crash on
the platform.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>A loud cheer is raised by the crowd, and young Leo
having thrown away his sword and pushed aside the
assistant executioner, has seized the head of the criminal
and torn off the bandage from his eyes. He holds it
high in the air by its purple locks and gloats with
fiendish satisfaction on its writhing features. The
muscles of the face are fearfully convulsed, as if the
spirit had not as yet quite departed, but still lingered
about the corpse, being loth to leave its tenement. The
eyes roll hideously and appear to gaze reproachfully
upon the face of the young executioner. Suddenly a
change comes over the features of the young man. His
countenance, the moment before so flushed with triumph
and revenge, now assumes a ghastly pallor; a cold sweat
breaks out on his forehead, his matted locks stand on
end. His eyes start from his head, his jaw drops low.
Then, with a preternatural shriek, he drops the head,
which rolls down the hillock of earth among the crowd,
staggers and falls heavily upon the platform, gasping out
"<i>Oh, Gott! mein Vater!</i>"</p>

<p>No words can describe the sensation created among
the crowd at this horrible scene. Questions and explanations
ensued, and a rush was made towards the
scaffold. Assistance was at length procured, and the
son of the late executioner was lifted from the ground
and driven toward his own house in the cart that he had
set out in that morning to execute his fearful mission.
A doctor was sent for, who declared that he was in an
apoplectic fit. In time, however, he recovered, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
doctor left someone with him to attend to him and
keep him quiet. Nevertheless, when he came to reflect
upon what had happened that morning, in spite of all
restraint, he rushed wildly into the chamber where his
poor paralytic mother lay on her death-bed, and losing
all caution and reflection in his emotion, he related in a
wild and excited manner the dreadful events of the day.
The result may be anticipated. The poor woman, long
given up by the doctors, sank under the startling news,
and expired almost instantaneously.</p>

<p>Young Leo, who, with the exception of his drunkenness
had really nothing very bad in him, now gave way
to the most excessive grief, for he loved his mother
tenderly. He felt himself now guilty of the murder of
both his parents, and refused all consolation. What had
he now to live for, thought he. His father he had
murdered with his own hands and sent with curses to
the tomb; his mother, so dear to him he had hurried to
the grave through his insane want of self-restraint. His
lady-love, false (as he thought), for secretly they had
plighted their troth together. What was life to him now
but a burden? He loathed it. These gloomy thoughts
clouded his mind with a profound melancholy, a deep
incurable despair. On the following morning Leo
Wenzel, the young executioner, fell upon his own sword,
yet moist with the blood of his father, by him so unconsciously
shed on the day before.</p>

<p>With the death of Leo Wenzel the family became extinct,
and the profession of the Scharfrichter went begging.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
But who was the assistant executioner? Nobody
could find out. He had disappeared as mysteriously
as he had made his appearance. Some said it was one,
and some another, while the most settled belief was that it
could be none other than the arch-fiend himself who
had come to carry off the Henker's soul. In the confusion
that followed the swoon of young Leo he had
vanished, and no one had seen whither. No human
being could have passed through a crowd without being
seen by someone, therefore it must have been the arch-enemy
of mankind. Thus reasoned the people of &mdash;&mdash;dorf.</p>

<p>And Lieschen, what became of her? Poor girl!
the news of her lover's suicide, for she had truly loved
the youthful headsman, had completely overwhelmed
her. She fell into a decline and outlived her lover but
one year.</p>

<p>The servant of the burgomaster was mistaken in
believing that after Leo's death the course would be
now clear for him. His heartless scheme had come to
light (for it was difficult to keep anything long a secret
in &mdash;&mdash;dorf), and he found the door of Lieschen's
house closed upon him for ever.</p>

<p>He soon knew himself hated by all the town, and
tradition goes on to relate that some years afterwards,
when he was in the service of another master, his employer
having missed certain articles of plate and
called in the police to search his coffers, they found not
only the missing articles, but also a black mask and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
suit of sad coloured clothes, recognised as having been
worn by the assistant on the day of Wenzel's execution.</p>

<p>Finding his reputation lost in &mdash;&mdash;dorf, he deemed
it advisable to retire to another village, where he afterwards
married. The last we hear of him is that he
ultimately accepted the office of Scharfrichter, and took
up his abode in the house of Franz Wenzel, where he
reared up a long line of executioners, which was only
broken many years later by the profession of the
Henker ceasing to be obligatory.</p>

<p>But what of our two friends Fritz and Ludwig? We
had nigh forgotten them. That they were both of
them present at the execution is undoubted from
certain passages in their correspondence after my ancestor
had left Germany for ever. The day after
Wenzel's execution was the last time they met on
earth. They each of them passed the remainder of
their days in their own respective countries though they
corresponded frequently. The most recently dated
letter from Ludwig Engstein bears with it the news of
his marriage, and in a postscript he mentions having
been just informed that since the execution of Franz
Wenzel the tricks of the Poltergeist had ceased for
ever.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Murmurs of applause were upon every lip as our
artist finished his narrative, when Mr. Oldstone, rising,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
thus addressed the club. "Gentlemen; I think you
will all agree with me that my friend Mr. McGuilp has
fully earned his sitting from the fair Helen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," cried several voices; "he has paid us
beforehand. Let him have his rights."</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened ajar and the head
of Dame Hearty appeared at the aperture to inform the
club that her daughter was now at their disposal.</p>

<p>"Let her be brought in!" shouted a chorus of
voices. "It is but fair that we should have one more
look at Helen before Mr. McGuilp walks off with
her."</p>

<p>Helen then appeared in the doorway and was greeted
enthusiastically by the whole club, in the midst of
which the painter, after looking at his watch and
ascertaining that it was yet early enough for a good
sitting, left the room and made for his studio, where,
having set his palette, he was joined shortly afterwards
by his fair model. Having arranged his colours and
placed his canvas on the easel, he sat contemplating
the portrait he had commenced so recently. Alas!
how flat and insipid his poor work looked after having
gazed on the bright original! It was but the first
painting, it is true, and we know that nothing really
good can be done at once; but, then, what drawing
he found to correct now that he looked at his work with
a fresh eye! The awfulness of the difficulties in art
now rose up in his mind to appal him, and he uttered
a sigh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can all the glazing and scumbling in the world,"
muttered he to himself, "ever advance this portrait one
step towards the divine original?"</p>

<p>Thus musing, the painter seized the canvas in
both hands and breathed over its surface. Immediately
afterwards, mixing up some colour sparingly,
he scumbled over the entire surface of the portrait.
Helen, whose eye dwelt upon the artist's every movement,
whether from curiosity, or from some mysterious
sympathy she felt for the young painter, demanded
of him why he breathed on the face of her picture.</p>

<p>"To breathe into it the breath of life, Helen,"
replied McGuilp, smilingly.</p>

<p>Helen opened her large blue eyes with an expression
of half wonderment, half doubt, not knowing
whether the painter spoke in jest, or whether an artist
really had some occult power in his very breath that
could vivify the canvas. How was she to know, poor
innocent child! Village bred and born in an age, as our
readers will recollect, before photography had rendered
too familiar the representation of the human face even
for the veriest peasant any longer to wonder at the art
by which it is produced?</p>

<p>In the days we speak of the painter's art was the
only mode of transfixing the lineaments of a dear friend
or parent and rendering them immortal. Painters, too,
were much less common then than now-a-days, for art
was still in its infancy in plain matter-of-fact old England.
The painter, or limner as he was then called, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
a being of far greater interest than at the present day.
He was patronised by royalty and nobility, and though
the prices that he received for his works were considerably
less than in our times, and he was nearly
always a poor and needy individual, yet he met with
a certain amount of respect from his patrons, as they
knew that by his hand alone could they hope to become
immortal. Everyone liked to see his own features represented
upon canvas, or those of his wife and family.
Oft times his favourite horse or dog. In order to secure
the services of the limner therefore, it was necessary to
court him, nor was this respect or appearance of such
ever denied him, save perhaps by the pampered menial
of some nobleman or wealthy squire, who looked superciliously
down upon the itinerant painter as a being far
inferior to himself. We will hope, however, for the
honour of humanity that the number was comparatively
small that measured the painter's respectability by
the length of his purse.</p>

<p>Indeed, the titled and the wealthy seem to have
prided themselves in doing everything in their power
to set the example of respect towards a disciple
of the fine arts. Among this class the painter had
seldom anything to complain of; in fact, provided he
were affable in manner, decent in appearance, could
paint the ladies' hands and ears small enough to please
them, their eyes sufficiently large and languishing, and,
lastly&mdash;but which was of no small importance&mdash;could
represent faithfully the texture of their silks and satins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
their lace, velvet, fur, or swansdown, oh, then he was
caressed, petted, and acknowledged by all as a most
agreeable member of society and sure of making his
fortune. But woe to him if he were above his business
and attempted high art&mdash;we mean subject pictures
that were not portraits. However much he might be
gifted in that line, his friends would instantly desert
him, and he might starve in a garret. His patrons knew
nothing of high art and cared as little. All they wanted
was to see their own effigies adorning the walls of their
mansions, and as long as the limner was content to be
of service to them they were willing to support him,
but no longer. It was set down as an axiom that the
human <i>face</i> divine&mdash;by which they meant their own
faces&mdash;was the highest aim that a painter could aspire
to. This was the sort of high art they wanted, and no
other.</p>

<p>A painter must be content with the work his patrons
set him to do and not indulge his own caprices. Well,
well, admitting the range of the painter's art to have
been cramped and limited, has any age or country the
power to cramp the genius of an artist? Is high art
only to be found in imaginative pictures? Does not a
portrait become high art under a master hand? Can
that be called a mechanical art that gives intellect or
sentiment to the eye, firmness or softness to the lip, the
natural bloom to the cheek, truth and beauty to the
whole? Few, let us hope, even in this matter of fact
age, but would rank the real artist before the photographic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
artisan who usurps his name. If, in the present
age, now that we are accustomed to a much more rapid
process of reproducing the human face, there are to be
found those who honour the true artist, imagine how
his art must have been held in honour when it was the
only way of immortalising men! It need not be
wondered at that among those classes where the appearance
of a painter was less common, that the respect
he inspired almost amounted to awe in certain instances.
This was the case with our Helen, who never having
set eyes before on a real artist, looked with awe and
wonder on our painter as a species of magician who
possessed an art not merely unknown in her humble
sphere, but which she was sure that the worthy members
of the club were alike ignorant of, however learned
they might be in other respects. The painter's youth
and good looks, together with his possessing this mysterious
art at such an early age, elevated him at once
into a hero in her eyes. Then there was the strange
fact of his having seen and spoken to a ghost in the
same house where she herself had been born and bred,
the very ghost she had been frightened so often with in
her childhood, but which was, nevertheless, so chary of
its appearance that it had found no one for upwards of
half a century worthy of revealing itself to until now,
and had chosen for that purpose the young artist before
her, and that, too, the very first night that he arrived at
the Inn. What was there peculiar in the organisation
of our painter, that he should have been selected before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
all others to gaze on the august presence of one risen
from the dead? The haunted chamber had been repeatedly
slept in by all the members of the club in
turn, and by many strangers beside, for years back, and
yet never before within the experience of our host had
the headless lady vouchsafed a parley with any one of
them. The preference, therefore, shewn towards our
friend McGuilp by the tenant of the haunted chamber
had raised him at once in the esteem of the whole club,
and the marked respect with which he was treated by
the other guests, all of them older men than himself,
did not fail to escape the quick eye of Helen, who felt
inwardly flattered that the man for whom she had
conceived so warm a sympathy, should be so honoured
among his better fellows.</p>

<p>Our artist and his model had been left together for
upwards of three-quarters of an hour, during which time
McGuilp had not opened his mouth to exchange a
single word with his sitter, a habit of his when unusually
engrossed in his work. He had glazed and scumbled,
chopped and changed about his drawing, laid on impasto,
worked upon the background, and so absorbed
was he with his picture, the time had passed as if it had
been five minutes. A considerable change, however,
had taken place in the portrait. There was more life
and vigour, the tints were more natural and the head
now stood more out in relief. Helen never once attempted
to break the silence, but remained modest and
immovable in her position as a statue. Had she been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a vain and foolish girl or a coquette, she might have
been irritated by the painter's silence, misconstruing
it into a sign of insensibility to her charms, but no such
thought for a moment entered the head of our Helen.
On the contrary, she looked with the deepest awe and
reverence on the painter whose art required so much
silence and concentration, and instead of calling away
his attention from his work by some frivolous remark,
she mentally resolved to aid him to the utmost by
posing as patiently as it lay in her power.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, after a long sitting, a change is apt
to come over the face of the sitter. The muscles
become flaccid, the colour vanishes, the eye grows
vacant, and an expression of languor and weariness
takes the place of the bright healthy look that the
sitter bore at the commencement. This is especially
the case with young people, and so it was with Helen,
who, spite of her laudable endeavours to do justice to
her portrait painter, had unconsciously grown several
shades paler, and had so altered in expression that our
artist, finding it impossible to continue his work, deemed
it advisable to give his model a little repose.</p>

<p>"That will do, Helen, for the present," said he;
"take a little rest, until you can call back the roses to
your cheek and the life to your eye. There, then, you
may look if you like, but there is much to be done yet,
I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think you have done wonders this sitting,"
said Helen, as she stood contemplating her own portrait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
from behind the artist's chair, with her head resting on
her hand.</p>

<p>"It appears to me as like as it can possibly be
already. I do not see what more there is to do to it."</p>

<p>"Do you not, Helen?" said McGuilp. "Then you
are very easily satisfied, but it is not so with us. We
artists are the most discontented people under the sun.
We know that however well a portrait may be painted,
it can never come up to the original, and yet we are
never contented, even with our utmost endeavours to
approach it."</p>

<p>"Then, we who know nothing about your art are
happier in our ignorance than the artists themselves who
have studied art all their lives," remarked Helen.</p>

<p>"Very often," replied McGuilp with a sigh; "nevertheless,
there is a pleasure in the mere pursuit of art,
however far removed the work of the artist may be
from his ideal, that he would not exchange for the calm
satisfaction of the uninitiated who perceive no fault."</p>

<p>At this moment a sound of cheering and clapping of
hands proceeding from the club-room interrupted the
dialogue between the painter and his model.</p>

<p>"What can all that noise mean?" ejaculated Helen.
"Ah, I can guess. Mother has just finished telling her
story to the gentlemen of the club, and they are applauding
her."</p>

<p>"Is it so, Helen?" said McGuilp.</p>

<p>"Well, as they have been enjoying a story from
which we have been excluded, I see no reason why we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
should not have a story all to ourselves. What do you
say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, by all means," said Helen; "but I am a poor
storyteller. Pray do not ask <i>me</i> for one, but if you
know of a story, why of course I am all attention."</p>

<p>"Let me see, then," said McGuilp. "What sort of
story would you like to hear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, tell me something about Italy. <i>I should</i> like
to hear so," answered Helen.</p>

<p>"Would you? Then I think I can remember a
little circumstance that occurred in Italy within my
experience, which I will relate to you if you will resume
your seat, for I have but little time to lose. We can
work and talk at the same time. Your colour has now
returned, and my story may possibly help to preserve it
until the end of the sitting."</p>

<p>Helen then resumed her seat, and McGuilp having
seized once more his palette and brushes and placed
himself in front of his easel, continued his portrait
whilst he related the following story.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>The Three Pauls.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>&mdash;The Artist's Third Story.</h3>

<p>During my travels in Italy I happened once to be
sojourning for some time in an obscure and sequestered
Italian village high up in the Apennines, that chain
of mountains which runs through the entire peninsular
like the backbone of some antediluvian monster.</p>

<p>They are curious places, those Italian villages, with
their tall, narrow houses and small windows, built up
the slant of a mountain like steps of stairs. Their
quaint roofs, balconies, arches, and buttresses, with at
every step some rustic shrine containing a rude painting
or representation of the Virgin Mary (the Madonna as
they call her) or other saint. The narrow, dirty, ill-paved
streets, the tumbling-down houses, from the
windows of which the picturesque but dirty inhabitants
may almost shake hands with one another across the
road.</p>

<p>Then the odd nooks and angles in the by-streets
that meet the stranger's eye on either hand as he ascends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the uneven and slippery path-way leading to the highest
point of view, which is generally crowned by some ruined
feudal castle or fort built upon a rock and overgrown
with ivy. They have a distinct character of their own,
these mountain villages, and are as unlike as possible to
anything seen in England. A mere verbal description
is inadequate to give the faintest idea of their extreme
picturesqueness. They require to be seen, and when
this is impossible, a picture or sketch must give the
next best idea of them to the mind of the stranger.
I have several studies in oil-colour of these places
within my portfolio, which you may look at for a
moment if you like.</p>

<p>There, you see that it is quite unlike anything you
ever saw before. Look at those figures in the foreground,
how picturesque and yet how simple their costume is!
Well, but to proceed: the village where I was staying,
when the fact that I am about to relate occurred, was
one of the sort you see here. Ah! here is a sketch of
the very place, and there is the name of it written
underneath. I remember that it had a certain celebrity
in the country round about it, as the cathedral (!) in
the chief piazza or square boasted of a miraculous
picture of the Madonna, that had the reputation of
turning up its eyes, and in this manner contrived to heal
great numbers among the faithful who were blind, deaf
and dumb, maimed, halt, or lame.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I ever witnessed one of these
miracles, but that may have been from my want of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
faith; yet the tales that I heard of miraculous cures
from persons of some repute, the arch-priest of the
parish amongst the number, were most startling.</p>

<p>I had taken up my quarters in a comfortable rustic
inn, not in the town itself, but on a separate hill in an
isolated spot, being built in its own grounds, fertile with
olive trees, which grew up the sides of the hill nearly to
the door of the house.</p>

<p>The inn was frequented almost entirely by artists.
Sometimes we were a large company, composed of all
nations, when we would dine together "al fresco" under
the shade of the vine which formed a verandah on one
side of the house. At other times I would be left alone
in the inn. The hill on which I lived commanded an
extensive view of the surrounding mountains, including
the township with its old ivy-grown tower overlooking
all, and which appeared as if it were sliding down the
mountain side.</p>

<p>I experienced an indescribable feeling of delight in
rambling alone through this romantic scenery on a hot
summer's day, beneath a perfectly cloudless sky, without
a breath of wind to rustle the leaves of the shady trees,
amidst a solitude like that of the desert, and a silence
unbroken save by the chirping of the birds and the
chattering of the cicala, or at intervals, perchance, the
distant shepherd's pipe, or the wild barbaric chant of
the mountaineer. With what rapture, I remember,
would I step from crag to crag, trampling the bush and
bramble under my feet, and startling away the green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
lizards in my path! Quaffing the beauties of nature at
every step, the dreamy influence of the balmy atmosphere
intensifying my feelings for the beautiful to an
abnormal degree.</p>

<p>It was on one of these sultry days during my rambles
that I was taking shelter from the burning sun under the
shade of a wide-spreading oak, reclining lazily on the
soft moss, and listening to the chirping of the grass-hoppers,
when my ear was attracted by the sound of the
bleating of goats, and shortly afterwards I heard the
voices of two peasants which seemed familiar to me.
They were discoursing together in the dialect of their
own village, a very different lingo from the pure Tuscan,
and perfectly unintelligible to one lately coming from
Rome, yet a prolonged stay in these parts rendered it
familiar to me. I recognised the voices as belonging,
one of them to a goatherd who supplied me with milk
in the morning, the other to a peasant who possessed a
vineyard, a small barrel of whose wine I had bought the
day before.</p>

<p>"Oh&egrave;! Antonio," cried Guiseppe, the goatherd, to
his friend, "so I hear you have sold a <i>quarteruolo</i> of
wine to the Signor Inglese (the English gentleman) who
lives on the hill."</p>

<p>"Well, Compar,"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> said his friend, "and what of
that?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<p>"I suppose you made him pay well for it, eh?"
demanded the goatherd.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Antonio, "I make my friends pay
sixteen pauls the <i>quarteruolo</i>, but he, being an Englishman,
I charged double."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the goatherd, "thirty-two pauls
for a <i>quarteruolo</i>!"</p>

<p>"Ay, and he paid me money down without haggling
about the price, like one of our '<i>paini</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> These
Englishmen are real gentlemen&mdash;they let themselves be
cheated without wincing. Those are the sort of men
I like to deal with. I was quite angry with myself
afterwards at not having asked four times the sum; he
would be sure to have paid me."</p>

<p>"<i>Accidente!</i> what a swindler!" exclaimed Guiseppe.
"Well, they tell me these English roll in wealth; that
gold is as common in their country as beans here. They
say the streets are paved with it. How I should like to
go to those parts, and come back with my pockets
filled with the gold that these idiots throw away like
dross. I wouldn't fatigue myself all day long in the
mountains for a piece of '<i>maritozza</i>'<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> or a dish of
'<i>polenta</i>.'"<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Antonio, "I've no doubt of it.
I should like to see <i>you</i> with money, friend Peppe.
You'd make a rare use of it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Per Bacco!</i> wouldn't I?" answered the goatherd;
"you wouldn't catch me sober again until the
day of my death. If I could sell my milk to the
Englishman at the rate you sell your wine, I'd soon
make my fortune."</p>

<p>"Well," said Antonio, "I would try it on if I were
you. Perhaps milk isn't to be had in his country."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said the goatherd, musingly. "It
must be a curious country from all accounts. They tell
me they never see the sun from one year's end to the
other, and, indeed, how can they, when the sun is here
all day? I hear, too, that the fog is so thick that you
are obliged to cut it through with a knife as you go
along the streets, and that the inhabitants are obliged
to burn lamps all day long."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have heard so, too," answered Antonio,
"and that they have no wine in their country. Well,
upon the whole, I'd sooner live where I am."</p>

<p>"Ah, but the gold that is to be found about the
streets," said Guiseppe, "you forget that."</p>

<p>"What would be the good of all the gold, if there is
no wine to buy with it?" replied Antonio. "I am very
well content to live by the sale of my wine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At the rate you sell it to Englishmen, I've no
doubt," broke in Peppe, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend, of course we all try to get what
we can, where we can, and how we can," pleaded
Antonio. "That's only business. I'd be a fool if I
didn't."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Compar, I suppose we are all much alike in
that; but don't you think that after having cheated the
Englishman out of all that money, you could lend me
three pauls?"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>"Ah, Peppe, you rascal, I thought that was coming,"
laughed Antonio. "What! lend <i>you</i> three pauls!
Why, when do you think you would be able to pay
me?"</p>

<p>"Well, I make two pauls a day by the sale of my
milk and go halves with my <i>padrone</i>.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> That is a paul
a day for us apiece. In three days, therefore, I shall be
able to pay you the entire sum. If I can manage to gull
the Englishman, I may pay you sooner," responded the
goatherd.</p>

<p>"Ah! Peppe," said Antonio, "I know you to be a
slippery customer. How am I to be sure you will pay
me within that time?"</p>

<p>"I give you my word of honour," cried Peppe.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! what is that worth?" laughed his friend.</p>

<p>"May I die of an accident, if I don't! May the earth
open and swallow me up! May the Madonna cause
my mouth to fall off if I fail in my word. May&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There; that is enough," interrupted his friend.
"Here are the three pauls. Take them, and if you fail
to pay me back in three days' time&mdash;not one hour later,
may all the curses that you have invoked upon yourself
be fulfilled."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>This was all I overheard of the dialogue. Shortly
after this they must have separated, as I heard soon the
voice of the goatherd in the distance, chanting in that
wild strain, with a prolonged dwelling on the last note
peculiar to the peasantry in the Italian mountains.</p>

<p>It was past midday when I rose from my mossy
couch and sauntered leisurely home, where, having partaken
of a light lunch, I continued working upon my
picture&mdash;a large landscape&mdash;until sundown. I was at
that time the only guest at the inn, and I have no
doubt that mine host and his family made as much out
of me as they could in one way or another, yet they
were as honest as the people in those parts mostly are,
and when not occupied with writing home I was in the
habit of joining the family circle after supper, when they
entertained me with the gossip of the village and stories
of brigands, by whom the country was much infested,
while I, in return for their information, related to them
many things about my own country, my travels, etc.
The conversation that I had overheard that morning,
however, between the goatherd and his friend I deemed
not of sufficient importance to relate to the family; in
fact, I had forgotten all about it before I reached the inn.</p>

<p>The unscrupulous manner in which people cheated
among these simple seeming peasantry rather amused
than annoyed me. And as for the simple incident of
one peasant borrowing three pauls from another, it was
a fact so uninteresting to me, that I never gave the
matter a second thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Little did I imagine that the transaction of the three
pauls that I by chance overheard that morning was to
be the commencement of one of the drollest waggeries
that ever came within my experience.</p>

<p>It was more than a week after the incident that I
have related occurred that I left my inn one morning to
paint out of doors at the distance of a mile or so. As
I journeyed along the road, laden with my painting
materials, I came in sight of the goatherd's hut, built
upon a hill, and though it was yet distant, I descried a
figure in the act of leaving the hut, but which I could
distinctly see was not the goatherd.</p>

<p>The figure had descended the hill, reached the road,
and was then making towards me. I had now no difficulty
in recognising my friend of whom I had bought
the wine. He appeared to be anything but in good
spirits, for he advanced scratching his head and with his
eyes fixed on the ground.</p>

<p>This was our first meeting since our transaction of
the barrel of wine, and had I been in a less good
humour I might have taxed him with swindling me in
good round terms, but with the fresh morning air in my
face and the enchanting landscape around me, I felt in
no humour to quarrel with anyone. I thought, however,
I would make him aware that I knew how he had
served me without losing my temper.</p>

<p>"<i>Buon giorno, Antonio</i>,"&mdash;(Good-day, Anthony)&mdash;I
said, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"<i>Ah! Eccellenza; buon giorno</i>," replied he, with a
sickly attempt at a smile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"You seem a little out of spirits, eh?" said I.
"Now, what would you say if I could read your
thoughts?"</p>

<p>"You read my thoughts, Eccellenza! You joke
with me."</p>

<p>"No," replied I; "without joking I will tell you
what is passing in your mind. You have just come
from the house of Guiseppe the goatherd, and you are
disappointed because he has not paid you the three
pauls that he promised to pay you after three days. Am
I right?"</p>

<p>"<i>Per Bacco!</i>" exclaimed Antonio. "Surely your
Excellency is a saint, and it has been revealed to you.
How else could you have known that?"</p>

<p>"Does that surprise you," said I. "What would
you say if I could tell you more? If I could tell you
the day and the hour that you lent the three pauls to
your friend? What would you say if I told you it was
last Tuesday week in the forenoon, and how you first
hesitated to lend the money, having some doubt as to
your friend's integrity, but how, after having invoked
certain curses on his own head in default of his not
being able to pay, you at length yielded, and lent him
the three pauls?"</p>

<p>"<i>Diavolo!</i> Eccellenza must be a saint indeed to
know all that," cried the peasant, dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"Would you like to know more?" I asked. "At
the expiration of the three days you have been regularly
every morning to the house of the goatherd, expecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to receive the three pauls, and each time he has sent
you away with a different excuse."</p>

<p>"<i>O anime sante mie del Purgatorio!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> exclaimed
the peasant, crossing himself devoutly. "Either your
Excellency is a saint, or you have the demon within you."</p>

<p>"Ha! say you so?" said I. "I will even venture
to prophecy that you will never get the three pauls."</p>

<p>"Oh, pray don't say that, Signor. Pray don't say
that I shall <i>never</i> be paid. Why should your Excellency
think so?" asked the peasant, dismally.</p>

<p>"Why! do you ask? Because the saints love you
not," said I.</p>

<p>"How, Signor? Was that also revealed to you?
Why should they not love me? How have I merited
their wrath?" he asked, whiningly.</p>

<p>"By charging me twice the sum you charge other
people for that <i>quarteruolo</i> of wine, and for repenting
afterwards that you had not asked me four times the
sum, as, being an Englishman, you thought to get it
out of me."</p>

<p>"<i>Corpo di San Antonio di Padova!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> cried the
peasant, casting up his eyes. "Is nothing to be hid
from you? Well, Eccellenza, what serves it to deny
the truth, since you know everything? I am a poor
man, and when an opportunity occurs for bettering
myself, I am apt to do what most men do who know
what want is."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, my friend," said I "you will find through
life that 'honesty is the best policy,' and that 'cheats
never prosper,' at least, for long. For when the cheat
is discovered, his reputation is lost for ever, while the
honest man who sticks steadily to his labour, and puts
aside his scanty earnings, not wasting them in drinking
or gambling, in the end is blessed by the saints who
give him fortune."</p>

<p>"That is most true," replied the peasant.
"Eccellenza has spoken like the preacher," and seizing
my hand, he kissed it, and was about to proceed on his
journey.</p>

<p>"Stay," said I. "Would you like to earn two
pauls?"</p>

<p>"Willingly, Eccellenza; but how?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Help me to carry these traps to my camping place,
and carry them back again when I return this evening,"
said I.</p>

<p>Without further parley he relieved me of my
burden, and we both trudged on together.</p>

<p>At first we walked on in silence, but after the first
half-mile, to relieve the monotony of the walk, I began
to question my companion as to the reception his friend
Guiseppe had given him and the excuses he had made
for not being able to pay his debt.</p>

<p>"Well, Eccellenza," he began, "you, who know
everything, are well aware that I called at Peppe's house
at the time appointed for the payment of the debt, and
that not being able to pay me, he excused himself by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
saying that the goats had given so little milk, that he
could not fulfil his promise as he expected, but he
promised faithfully to repay me on the morrow. I
called the next day, when he begged me to be patient
with him, as he had lost the money through a hole in
his pocket. I was annoyed at this, but called again on
the morrow, hoping at least to get a portion of the
money back; but no such luck. This time he pleaded
that his wife had been suddenly seized with the fever,
and begged me not to be too hard upon him.</p>

<p>"'Then take care that she is better to-morrow,' said
I, 'for I want my money.'</p>

<p>"The next day (that was yesterday) I called again,
and his wife informed me that her husband had caught
the fever, and was dangerously ill. She hoped, however,
that it would soon pass over, and he would be able to
pay me as he had promised. I went again this morning
to Peppe's house as usual for the money, when his wife
came out to me with tears in her eyes, to inform me that
her husband died last night. I began to lose patience,
and said that, dead or alive, I meant to have my three
pauls back; and off I went, cursing and swearing. It
was then that your Excellency met me."</p>

<p>As Antonio finished speaking we had already
arrived at our camping place, and I commenced
arranging my painting materials. The latter part of
Antonio's narrative immensely amused me, as I had
both seen and spoken to Peppe that morning early
when he brought the milk as usual to the door of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
inn, and he never looked in better health in his life. I
remember upbraiding him for putting water in the milk,
and telling him not to try on his tricks with me, as
Englishmen knew what good milk was, adding that if I
caught him at it again, I should change my goatherd.
I suppose something like a smile must have passed
over my countenance at the idea of Peppe pretending
to be dead, in order to get off paying three pauls, for
Antonio, eyeing me narrowly, said,</p>

<p>"What say you, Eccellenza? You know everything.
Tell me if Peppe is really dead, or whether this is also a
pretence."</p>

<p>I put on a wise look, and said, looking him full in
the face, "I know him to be alive."</p>

<p>"Ha! say you so, Eccellenza?" cried Antonio,
starting up from his seat on the ground. "Then <i>per
Crispo</i>!<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> I'll murder him when I catch him."</p>

<p>"There is no occasion to do that, my friend," said I.
"You will not get your three pauls back the sooner if
he hasn't the money."</p>

<p>"I'll go to his house again, though, if your Excellency
can dispense with my services for the present," said
Antonio, "in the hopes of catching him; though, if
he is alive, he will be away in the mountains, feeding
his goats; but no matter, I'll enter the house and see
for myself if the bed is empty or no."</p>

<p>"Go then," said I, "and return in an hour to let me
know the result of your visit."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Off started Antonio, as fleetly as the wind, and
before I could have thought it possible, returned
without appearing out of breath.</p>

<p>"Well?" said I, working steadily on my picture
without looking up.</p>

<p>"Well, Eccellenza," he began, "I went straight to
the house, and tried the door, but it was locked, and
there was no one within. I peeped through the
window, but could not catch a glimpse of the bed.
I descended the hill in a rage, when at some little
distance, I saw Peppe's wife. I ran to her and told her
that I wanted to speak to her husband, as I had found
out that he was living. She persisted in saying that
it was false, and that her husband lay dead in his
bed."</p>

<p>"'Then let me see the corpse,' said I.</p>

<p>"She replied that she was not going to fatigue
herself to mount the hill again to show me the corpse.
That if I didn't choose to believe her, I needn't.</p>

<p>"'Give me the key of the house, then,' said I, 'that
I may go in and satisfy myself.'</p>

<p>"She replied that she never trusted anyone with the
key of her house, and turned away.</p>

<p>"I then lost my temper, and told her that both she
and her husband were a couple of swindlers, who had
schemed to defraud me of my money. Then she burst
into tears again, and said that if I really wished to be
convinced that her husband was dead, I might go to
the church myself this evening, where the corpse of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
husband would be lying in state,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and that I might hide
myself in one of the confessionals, and watch all night
to see if he moved at all, and that if he stirred ever so
little, never to believe her again.</p>

<p>"Now, you see, Eccellenza, how artful women
are. She hopes in that way to intimidate me and to
make me believe that her husband is dead in real earnest.
She fancies that I would be frightened to spend a whole
night inside the church with a corpse, and that I won't
go. If, then, I should call at her house to-morrow
she would be sure to tell me that her husband was
already buried. I do not for a moment believe that
her husband will be exposed in the church all night,
feigning to be dead; but, just to give her the lie, I
am determined to do just as she says, and hide myself
in one of the confessionals, that I may be able to tell
her that I passed the night in the church, and there was
no corpse to be seen."</p>

<p>"Do so, my friend," said I. "I am most curious to
hear how this affair ends."</p>

<p>As we were discoursing together Antonio suddenly
broke short his discourse.</p>

<p>"Hark, Signor!" he cried. "Do you hear? Those
are death-bells that are tolling in the village. Can
someone really have died, or has Peppe's wife set them
tolling to impose upon me all the more? What say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
you, Signor? Would she carry out the joke as far as
all that?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing like doing a thing well," I
answered, evasively.</p>

<p>"I shall be able to find out from the sacristan for
whom he has been tolling the bell this morning," said
Antonio, "and if that knave of a Peppe is not dead
yet, may I die of an accident if I don't worry him to the
death. You must know, Eccellenza, that three pauls to
us poor devils is a consideration, unimportant though
the sum may be <i>alla vostra Signoria</i>.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> What a
conscience the man must have to try and swindle me
out of what I lent him in friendship, after swearing to
me on his word of honour and invoking all sorts of curses
on his own head if he failed to pay me on the day he
promised! Had not your Excellency positively assured
me that he still lives, I should be inclined to think that
he had died in real earnest, as a punishment for his
broken faith."</p>

<p>I was amused at the word "conscience" from the
lips of a man like Antonio, and the old fable of "the
pot calling the kettle black" flashed across my mind.
We are wonderfully alive to the weak points of others'
consciences where our own interests are concerned, but
are too often wanting in equal rigour over ourselves.
How true is that parable in Scripture of the mote and
the beam!</p>

<p>In order to proceed with my narrative, I must pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
on to the following day. Feeling slightly indisposed
from a fever on waking that morning&mdash;nothing serious,
but just enough to prevent me from painting out-of-doors,
as I had intended&mdash;I kept my bed later than
usual, and called to my landlady to bring me a basin of
broth.</p>

<p>As she entered my bedchamber with the steaming
fluid, I noticed by the animated expression of her face
that she had news of unusual importance to communicate
to me.</p>

<p>"Oh, Signor!" she exclaimed, as she hastened to
place the broth on a table beside me, "what do you
think has happened in the village? A miracle! a
miracle! nothing short of a miracle, blessed be the
Madonna. <i>Si Signor</i>," she added, in answer to a
smile that she observed on my countenance, "one
of the most wonderful miracles that ever our blessed
Virgin has deigned to vouchsafe to us, her unworthy
servants. Blessed be her holy name for all eternity!"</p>

<p>"Well," said I, calmly sipping my broth, "another
miracle! let's hear it."</p>

<p>"Ah! Signor, you do not believe in miracles," said
the hostess; "but how will you deny <i>this</i>? Just hear.
You may not have heard, perhaps, that poor Peppe
the goatherd died suddenly of a fever, and was laid out
in the church, where he remained all last night. Some
robber, towards the morning, broke into the church,
and would have robbed the alms-box. He had
succeeded in unscrewing it from the wall and bursting it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
open&mdash;at least, I presume so, for how else could he have
got to the money?&mdash;and was seated on the ground,
counting his gains&mdash;a most incredible amount, chiefly
consisting of gold. I am sure I don't know where it all
came from, for only yesterday when I put in a <i>baiocco</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
myself, the sound it made showed me that it was all but
empty. Well, as I was saying, he was counting his
gains by the light of the candle, placed at the head
of the corpse, when our blessed lady caused life to
return to the defunct, who, leaping up suddenly from
his bier, seized the robber by the throat, and called
aloud for help. Our honest Peppe held the sacrilegious
miscreant as in a vice until the sacristan entered the
church to light the candles. You may imagine, Signor,
the dismay of the sacristan at seeing the corpse that had
been laid out in the church all the previous evening,
now resuscitated, and holding in his grasp the wretch
who had attempted to defraud the church of the
alms that pious souls had given to support her.</p>

<p>"The worthy sacristan had not recovered from his
surprise when the people began to pour in by twos and
threes to hear mass, all of them starting and falling back
in horror at the spectacle before them.</p>

<p>"'A miracle! a miracle!' cried the sacristan, at
length. 'Behold the Virgin has been merciful to us.
Blessed be the name of the Madonna!'</p>

<p>"At that instant the arch-priest himself entered,
attired in his robes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"'What is this?' he cried, in astonishment,
retreating several steps. 'Holy saints! was not this
the corpse laid out in the church last evening?'</p>

<p>"Here the sacristan broke in.</p>

<p>"'A miracle, Signor <i>Arciprete</i>, a miracle! a most
undeniable miracle. I caught this robber this morning
attempting to rob the alms-box, when lo! it pleased the
Madonna to give back life to the dead in order to save
her holy church from being violated by sacrilegious
hands.'</p>

<p>"The good Peppe, still holding fast the robber,
informed the arch-priest and the congregation that every
word the sacristan had spoken was true; that he had
been dead, but had been miraculously called back to
life again by the grace of our blessed Lady in order to
secure the thief.</p>

<p>"'You lie! you lie! You know you lie!' gasped
out the burglar, as he tried to free himself from the
iron grasp of the resuscitated corpse. 'Impostor! knave!
swindler,' he called out, nearly suffocated by the firm
grip of Peppe.</p>

<p>"But his words were lost in the sensation caused
by the crowd, who permitted no explanation on the
part of the criminal. The guard having now arrived,
he was walked off to prison amid the execrations of the
crowd. The arch-priest, who, through all this scene had
remained stupefied for a time, as well he might, at
length broke silence.</p>

<p>"'There is some mystery that I am as yet unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
comprehend. I am informed by the sacristan that he
discovered the burglar in the act of robbing the alms-box
of the church, and the money on the ground that
you all see, he avers to have been taken out of the
alms-box. Now, in order to extract the money from the
alms-box the thief must previously have broken it open,
yet I see no marks of violence on the box of any kind.</p>

<p>"'Then there is another thing worthy of notice.
The alms-box was emptied only last week, in order to
distribute its contents amongst the poor. How comes
it now, then, there appears such a large quantity of
money, which, you see, consists chiefly of gold and
silver, besides paper money; and that diamond ring
I see, whence is that? I think it will be found that
the heap of money on the ground will be too large a
sum to enter into the box. If it cannot enter, how
could it have come out of it?'</p>

<p>"'All the greater miracle,' cried the sacristan, devoutly.</p>

<p>"'True, true,' cried the people. 'A double miracle!
Great is the power of the Madonna.'</p>

<p>"'Well, well, my people,' said the arch-priest, 'I
own that I am puzzled beyond measure; nevertheless,
as it has pleased our gracious Lady to let us find this
goodly sum here in the middle of the church, it is clear
that she has but one intention&mdash;namely, that the sum
should be distributed for the glory of her name. Therefore,
let the treasure be replaced in the alms-box for
the enlargement and decoration of the church.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"This decision of their pastor was approved of by
the pious flock, and the sacristan hastened to fill the box
with as much of the treasure as it was capable of containing,
while still a large portion remained over. This,
together with the diamond ring, the arch-priest took
possession of, declaring that the whole sum should be
used for the enlarging and fitting up of his church."</p>

<p>Having concluded her narrative, my worthy hostess
perceived something like a smile of incredulity on
my countenance, which seemed rather to irritate her.
However, I comforted her by saying that I would
investigate the matter myself, and if, after a careful and
strict inquiry, I could not account for the whole matter
by natural causes, I would then become as much a
believer in the miracle as she was herself.</p>

<p>This seemed to pacify her, and she encouraged me
in seeking every possible means to disprove it. Accordingly,
in an hour's time I was up and dressed, and
bending my steps towards the township. Part of this
curious tale I had already accounted for in my own
mind. That Peppe had not been dead, but had feigned
to be so, that I knew. The supposed robber I concluded
must be Antonio. I supposed that the latter,
having discovered at length the imposition practised
upon him by his companion, a quarrel had ensued, in
the midst of which they had been surprised by the
sacristan; but I could guess no more than this.</p>

<p>The affair of the treasure being found in the church
completely puzzled me, and my curiosity being aroused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
I set straight off to the house of the arch-priest, whom
I knew intimately, to hear either the confirmation or
confutation of my hostess's statement.</p>

<p>On passing the church in the chief piazza or square
of this little town, I met the sacristan, whom, having
been an eye-witness to the whole, I stopped and inquired
as to the truth of the rumour that had spread so
quickly throughout the village. He put on a sanctified
look, crossed his hands upon his breast, and rolled up
the white of his eyes, solemnly declaring that every word
I had heard was true, that he himself had been an
eye-witness to the whole affair from first to last.</p>

<p>Then, after recounting to me the whole proceedings
in a long rigmarole, he wound up by calling on all the
saints to open the ground under his feet to swallow him
up, if what he spoke was not the truth. He then took
his leave.</p>

<p>Now, I never did like the appearance of this sacristan.
He was a young man, sallow and emaciated,
with an extremely repulsive countenance and an expression
of low cunning and avarice, which he sought
to hide under an affectation of sanctity and cringing
humility. He seemed unable to look you full in the
face, though I often caught him observing me out of
the corners of his half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>He would have been the last man in the world whose
word I should have taken for gospel, and there was
something in the manner in which he told his story that
impressed me with the idea, that whatever mystery there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
might be connected with the discovered treasure, that
<i>he</i>, in some way or another, was interested in the affair
being regarded as a miracle. I therefore attached very
slight importance to his testimony. In fact, I merely
addressed him in the hopes of discovering some discrepancy
in my hostess's narrative, being aware how
much a story gains in telling; but, to my surprise, I
found the two accounts remarkably consistent. A step
or two further took me to the house of the arch-priest,
which, being open, I entered, and was welcomed on the
landing by that worthy.</p>

<p>"Ah! Signor Vandyke," he said&mdash;you are always
called by your Christian name in Italy&mdash;"it is long
since I've had the pleasure of seeing you. You do not
often honour our humble township with your presence.
You have been hard at work as usual, I suppose,
eh?"</p>

<p>I replied that I had given myself a holiday for once
in a way, not feeling in a humour for work, and had
called upon him for the purpose of inquiring into the
truth of a reported miracle in the village. Hereupon he
beckoned me upstairs, made me sit down at a table, and
pouring out for me a tumbler of his own wine from a
huge jug, he proceeded to fill another for himself; then
tapping his snuff-box, a priest's inseparable companion,
and taking from it a copious pinch wherewith to clear
his brain, this dignitary recited to me the whole story of
the miracle, differing in little or nothing from the other
accounts that I had heard of it. Knowing him to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
thoroughly trustworthy and conscientious man, I felt sure
that he would not willingly deceive me; but fancying he
might in some way or other have been deceived himself,
I proceeded to cross-question him, though I could not
find that he contradicted himself in anything.</p>

<p>When I asked if he could vouch for the occurrence
being a miracle, he replied:</p>

<p>"I can only vouch for what I saw. The resuscitated
corpse was holding the accused in his grasp, while
I had the sacristan's word that the corpse had suddenly
become re-animated under his very eyes, and had
seized the burglar after he had succeeded in extracting
the money from the alms-box. I must confess I am
puzzled at the whole of that sum having been extracted
from the coffer, when, with the greatest pains the
sacristan could not replace more than half of it. I
have the rest here, as you see, and with it a handsome
diamond ring. That is the wonderful part, for who
wears diamonds in these mountains?"</p>

<p>I was now perfectly sure of one thing namely,
that the treasure had never been extracted from the
alms-box at all, but had been found in some other
manner. The testimony of the sacristan, as I have
said before, weighed little or nothing with me. So far
from it, indeed, that I began to see more clearly than
ever that there had been some trick or imposture, at the
bottom of which was the sacristan himself.</p>

<p>I did not give the arch-priest the result of my reflections,
but restrained myself until I should obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
further evidence. We had discoursed for full a couple
of hours on the subject, and when I rose to depart I
told him that I was as complete a sceptic as before, as
far as the miraculous character of the event was concerned,
though I placed every reliance in his statement.
I said I was perfectly sure of unveiling the
mystery before long, and when I had done so I should
at once let him know.</p>

<p>"And the delinquent," asked I, with my hand on
the doorhandle, "where is he?"</p>

<p>"Locked up, to be sure; ready to be taken to-morrow
to Gennazzano, there to await his trial."</p>

<p>"Could I exchange a word with him?"</p>

<p>"If you wish. I shall have to give you a line to
the guard, in order to admit you. Just one moment,&mdash;here&mdash;with
this pass they will let you enter."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. Till we meet again&mdash;<i>Addio</i>."</p>

<p>It was now growing towards evening as I hastened
my steps towards the lock-up house, where I delivered
the arch-priest's note to the guard, who immediately
gave orders to the turnkey to admit me. On entering
the cell I found Antonio, as I had expected, pacing up
and down dejectedly.</p>

<p>"Well, Antonio," said I, "I have come to have a
chat with you and to hear all about the miracle that
happened this morning."</p>

<p>"Ah! Signor, is it you?" cried he. "Now, was
there ever an unluckier mortal on earth than I?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense," said I, "about being unlucky. I have
come to comfort you in your trouble and to hear all
about the miracle."</p>

<p>"Miracle! The devil a miracle," exclaimed Antonio.
"They've miracled me within four walls, who am
innocent as the babe unborn, whilst they have let go
two of the greatest rascals in the village. It will be a
miracle if I escape incarceration for life when I take my
trial at Gennazzano."</p>

<p>"Come," said I, consolingly, "you must not look so
gloomily at things. I will do what I can to get you off,
but you must tell me exactly how the whole affair
happened."</p>

<p>"Ah! that I will, Signor, and with pleasure," said
he.</p>

<p>Walking me up and down his narrow cell, the
turnkey waiting at the door with his bunch of keys the
while, he began his story thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will remember, Eccellenza, that before parting
from you last, I informed you of my intention of concealing
myself within the confessional of the church
and to remain there all night, for the purpose of observing
attentively if the would-be corpse of Peppe
there laid out should make any movement or betray the
slightest signs of life.</p>

<p>"At a late hour, therefore, when all was dark&mdash;that
is to say, about three hours after Ave Maria&mdash;I entered
the church, and there was my late friend attired as a
corpse with a candle left burning at his head, as is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
custom, you know, Signor, in these parts. I approached
him, though not without a certain tremor, for to me
there has always been something solemn and awful in
being left alone with the dead, especially at midnight
when the corpse is laid out in state in the middle of the
church, with nothing but the feeble light of one candle
to illumine its ghastly features.</p>

<p>"Nor did this feeling at all abate when I reflected,
that in all probability the supposed corpse was not
really dead, but only feigning to be so. If anything, I
felt more terrified. However, I advanced steadily, and
gazed full in the face of it. It was very pale, and perfectly
motionless, and I began to think that this must be
death, and that your Excellency had been mistaken in
being so positive that my friend was yet alive.</p>

<p>"I fancied that perhaps you had seen his spirit and
had mistaken it for himself in the flesh. I forebore to
touch the corpse from that same feeling of awe that I
have just described, and though at the time I was perfectly
satisfied that he was really dead, yet I still resolved
to sit up all night, concealed within the confessional,
so as to be able to tell your Excellency on the
morrow that I had fulfilled my promise.</p>

<p>"I accordingly shut myself in, and gazed steadfastly
at the features of the corpse, never taking my eyes off
all the time, in order to assure myself beyond a doubt
whether this were really death or merely its counterfeit.
I gazed long and intently, but in vain did I endeavour
to discover the slightest breathing or other signs of life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Whether the dim light of one candle prevented me from
seeing sufficiently well, I know not.</p>

<p>"All was silent as the tomb, and as I gazed in
breathless suspense, hour after hour flew by, till at length
I heard the old church clock toll forth the dread hour
of midnight. The last stroke had hardly died away&mdash;How
shall I describe to you my terror, oh, Signor?&mdash;when
suddenly I heard the church doors violently
shaken. You know how nervous one becomes in the
dead of the night at hearing any sort of noise unexpectedly
that one cannot account for. Imagine, then,
my sensations, Eccellenza, if you can, when, hidden
within the confessional at this witching hour of night,
with every nerve on the stretch, and looking out into
the solemn gloom of the church, illumined only by the
solitary candle placed at the head of the corpse&mdash;when
all honest peasants, with their families, were in bed and
fast asleep, and the greatest silence reigned everywhere,
suddenly to hear a bang and a crash at the old church
doors, which soon gave way&mdash;you know how rotten they
are, Signor&mdash;and there entered, cursing and swearing, a
troop of&mdash;well, upon my soul, Signor, I took them to
be emissaries of the arch-fiend, sent to secure the soul
of the defunct.</p>

<p>"However, after having attentively examined their
forms, which were hardly less wild than those of the foul
fiends themselves, if all accounts of them be true, I satisfied
myself that they were, after all, human&mdash;men of flesh
and blood like ourselves. Signor, they were the brigands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should say there were about a dozen of them,
for I did not think of counting them, so great was my
fright. They rushed helter-skelter into the church, and
without as much as glancing at the corpse, seized the
candle that stood burning near its head, and, striding
towards the altar placed the candle thereon and proceeded
to count their ungodly gains. I trembled in
every limb; a cold sweat broke out on my forehead,
and I felt my hair stand up, while my teeth chattered
in my head.</p>

<p>"What would happen next? Would the Madonna
send a thunderbolt to destroy these sacrilegious wretches,
and perhaps myself at the same time? I quite expected
something of the sort. I am sure it is quite a wonder
that my hair hasn't turned white from the terrors I
underwent last evening.</p>

<p>"Well, Eccellenza, I presume these ruffians, after
having laid wait for the mail on the high road and
robbed a number of poor gentlemen of all they had
about them, had made off with their ill-gotten treasure
in the dead of the night, and, passing through the
village on their way, descried the glimmer of the candle
through the chinks of the church door, and thought they
would take this opportunity of dividing their spoil.</p>

<p>"The treasure was a goodly heap, consisting of gold,
silver, and paper money, besides a few gold watches,
which they all drew lots for, and a magnificent diamond
ring, which the brigand chief claimed for himself.</p>

<p>"'Now, my men,' said he after an equal portion had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
been allotted to each, 'I think every man in my band
has had a fair share of the booty. This ring alone I
claim the right of disposing of as head of the band,
seeing that it cannot be divided; yet, to show you all
in what high estimation I hold fair play, and how loath I
am to possess even a <i>baiocco</i> more than my valiant
companions without deserving it, I will award this ring
to the man who shall first succeed in hitting yon corpse
on the nose with it, I myself taking share in the pastime,
and as captain of the band claiming for myself
the first shot.'</p>

<p>"Enthusiastic cheers greeted this decision of their
chief, and the game began. The captain had the first
throw, but missed. Then a second picked up the ring
and also threw, but missed likewise. Then a third, with
the same result, and so on, till the seventh, who, more
dextrous than the rest, hit the corpse such a stinging
whack on the nose that it suddenly jumped up, shook
its head, extended its arms, and leaped down from the
bier.</p>

<p>"You see, the rascal had been shamming, after all,
sir, and, wearied out with feigning death, had actually
gone to sleep. Now, although I was half prepared for
such a resuscitation, the effect upon me was electrical;
but I recovered from my surprise soon enough to
enjoy the confusion of the brigands, who in their terror
and dismay at what they took to be a miracle wrought
by the saints on purpose to punish their impious conduct,
took to their heels, stumbling over one another in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
their flight, and letting drop all their treasure on the
ground unheeded, scampered out of the church as fast
as their legs could carry them.</p>

<p>"I was infinitely amused at the fright and discomfiture
of these lawless ruffians, and at another time
should have laughed heartily at their sudden dispersion,
but my rage at having been imposed upon, and the
thoughts of vengeance I harboured against my false
friend somewhat damped my mirth. No sooner were
the brigands safely out of the church than Peppe, who
was now sufficiently wide awake to comprehend the
situation, after closing the church doors carefully,
proceeded to spread a large handkerchief on the ground
and to collect together all the gold and silver that had
rolled about into every corner of the church, and which
I've no doubt he thought he alone was entitled to.</p>

<p>"It was at this moment that I made a sudden burst
from the confessional, and rushing towards him, seized
him by the throat.</p>

<p>"'Villain!' I cried, 'your imposture is found out.
Was it thus you hoped to swindle me out of my three
pauls?'</p>

<p>"'Ah, friend Antonio,' exclaimed he, quite unmoved,
'is it you? Now I am glad that with your own eyes
you have witnessed the miracle that the saints have
wrought upon me in order to enable me to pay back the
debt I owe to my best friend.'</p>

<p>"'Liar!' cried I; 'blaspheme not. Think not to
impose on me again. Give me my three pauls at once.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Three pauls!' he exclaimed. 'How on earth
should I possess so contemptible a sum? Come, sit
down here, and we will divide this goodly treasure
between us.'</p>

<p>"Now, I knew that I had just as much right to the
treasure as my friend, since it remained unclaimed, and
therefore to divide it between us was nothing more than
fair, nor did I thank Peppe for inviting me to take my
share of it. Chance had thrown it in our way, and
therefore I was entitled to the half of it.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I did not consider myself obliged to
cancel my friend's debt because of the good fortune that
had befallen us, but was determined that he should still
pay me the three pauls out of his share when the whole
should be divided, for the principle of the thing, for I
am very punctilious as to principle, especially when my
interests are affected.</p>

<p>"However, I said nothing until after we had divided
the treasure equally. This being done, some debate
arose as to what we should do with the diamond ring.
Peppe thought he had a right to it, as he said it was all
through him that the brigands had been put to flight and
had left us in possession of the treasure. He even
called me ungrateful and unreasonable when I disputed it
with him, after having allowed me a share of the booty.
I was not to be put off in this way. I told him that I
had a right to an equal share of the treasure, and owed
no thanks to him for the accident of good fortune that
had befallen us both. As to the ring, I said that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
either of us had a right to it more than the other it was
myself, as he was my debtor.</p>

<p>"'Avaricious man!' exclaimed he, 'do you still think
of exacting your miserable three pauls after my generosity
in making you a sharer of the treasure that belonged
properly to me? Have I not already paid you over and
over again the paltry debt I owed you? If the Madonna
had not brought me miraculously back to life you would
have had nothing.'</p>

<p>"'Peace, blasphemer!' cried I. 'Do you think to
befool me again with your imposture?'</p>

<p>"'<i>Imposture!</i>' he exclaimed, with an air of injured
innocence. 'Why, did you not see me rise from the
dead with your own eyes?'</p>

<p>"'Come, now,' said I, losing all patience, 'do you
think that I was not sharp enough to suspect your plot
from the very beginning, knowing what sort of character
I had to deal with? Do you imagine I couldn't see
through all your shamming&mdash;that I didn't see your
breast heaving?'</p>

<p>"'<i>My breast heaving! The breast of a corpse heaving!</i>'
he ejaculated. 'Strange hallucination! Trust me, my
dear friend, you must have been slightly in liquor, and
saw double.'</p>

<p>"'And do you think that I did not observe that
worn out with feigning death so long, you really
fell asleep,' said I, heedless of his insult, 'and that
I did not hear you snore like a hog?'</p>

<p>"'I snore like a hog!' he exclaimed. 'My dear friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
believe me, you must have been <i>very strongly</i> in liquor.'</p>

<p>"'No more in liquor than you,' I cried, with
some vehemence. 'That you were sound asleep I can
swear, nor would you have awoke till morning, had not
one of the brigands hit you on the nose with that ring.
Then, naturally forgetting your caution, you jumped up,
stretched yourself, which act of yours being sufficient
under the circumstances to strike terror among the
brigands, who, imagining no doubt, what you would like
me also to believe&mdash;viz., that a miracle had been
wrought to bring you back to life again, took to their
heels and left their treasure behind them.</p>

<p>"'Now, you can't well expect me to believe in what
you affect to consider a miracle, seeing that I have
been an eye-witness to your antics from the very
beginning, and as for trusting you with the ring until it
shall be converted into money, that would be too much
for you to expect from me, after the insight you have
given me into your character.'</p>

<p>"'Come now, old fellow,' said he, gaily, and with
most provoking good humour, 'let us have no more
words about it. We'll toss up for it. Nothing can be
fairer than that.'</p>

<p>"'I do not agree either to toss up for it or to draw
lots for it, as I am usually unlucky,' I replied, firmly.</p>

<p>"'Then we'll settle it between ourselves as the
brigands did. If I hit you on the nose with it, it is
mine. If you can hit me with it, it shall be yours.
Come&mdash;here goes.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I object to these proceedings,' I replied.</p>

<p>"'What will you do, then? Will you cut it in half
with a knife?'</p>

<p>"'Nor that either,' said I.</p>

<p>"'Well, now,' said he, 'you are one of the never-contented.
I see you are determined by hook or by crook
to keep the ring all to yourself.'</p>

<p>"'No,' I replied, 'I do not wish for anything that is
not strictly fair. What I propose is this&mdash;viz., that I
should keep the ring in my possession until you have
disbursed the three pauls out of your share. Then,
after the ring has been estimated by a trustworthy
party and turned into money, then we will share the
produce equally.'</p>

<p>"'Ho! ho!' laughed he, 'so that's what you are
after, is it? Ha! ha! I see it all. You fancy that
under the excuse of waiting for your three pauls (which
I know as well as you do yourself you do not care a
straw for, since you have become enriched with the half
of my treasure) that I am going to allow you quietly to
abscond with the ring, which may be worth as much as
all the treasure put together, for what I know, never to
be heard of afterwards. Well, that is a cool idea!
Ha! ha! ha!'</p>

<p>"'I protest,' said I, 'that such a thought never
entered my head.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, of course not,' said he, incredulously.
'Friend Antonio, it is clear that our respective mothers
hatched neither of us two yesterday. I am only a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
goatherd, yet I have learnt as much of the world from
watching the antics of my goats as you have in trailing
and pruning your vines. We are both of us men, and
we know what men are. We all have our wants, and
our brains were given us to supply them.'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' replied I, 'in a conscientious and legitimate
manner, and not to over-reach our fellow-men in the
shortest and most unscrupulous way that our petty
interests may dictate, to the scandal of all good saints
and the blessed Madonna at their head.'</p>

<p>"And here I launched out into a moral strain for
at least an hour, hoping to bring him round by dint of
argument and persuasion to my view of the case, but
finding him at the end of that time still obdurate, and
in the same state of hardness of heart as before&mdash;for
who can moralise with such a heathen as Peppe?&mdash;I
attempted to seize the ring by force, intending to keep
it until he should pay me the debt he owed me, but he
was before me, and a scuffle ensued, he declaring that he
would not suffer me to keep the ring in my possession,
and I being equally firm in refusing to let him keep it in
his without first paying me my three pauls.</p>

<p>"He promised faithfully to pay me the debt when
he should have changed one of the pieces of money
that fell to his lot; until then, however, I remained firm
in my resolution. Words had by this time led to blows,
and the conflict was getting desperate, when, it being
now fairly morning, we were interrupted by the sacristan
entering the church to light the candles on the altar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Starting back in wonderment and terror at what
he naturally believed to be a miraculous resuscitation, it
it was some time before he was sufficiently calm to
hear from me the true account of the case.</p>

<p>"At length, recovering from his stupor, his eyes
sparkled with an avaricious light at the divided treasure
on the ground, and his skinny fingers opened and shut
convulsively. Then gazing furtively over each shoulder,
he put his finger to his lip, winked, and whispered
hoarsely, 'My friends, the secret of your newly-acquired
wealth is as yet only known to us three. I think you
will find it to your interest that it should not be known
to more, as in that case it might come to the ears of
the arch-priest, who would be sure to deprive you of
every penny of it, in consideration of its being found
in his church. Reflect well, my friends; there is but
one way to swear me to secrecy.'</p>

<p>"'And that is?' asked I.</p>

<p>"'To let me have an equal share of the treasure,'
said he, impudently. 'What other way would you buy
my silence?'</p>

<p>"We both violently opposed this proposition, considering
it no less than an act of brigandage, and however
Peppe and I might differ in opinion on many subjects,
we both agreed that this was a piece of extortion
to which we were not bound to submit. I said that I
would sooner await the decision of the arch-priest,
which would perhaps, after all, not be such as he&mdash;the
sacristan&mdash;represented it, and Peppe swore that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
would knock his dastardly brains out in the middle of
the church before he would let him touch a <i>baiocco</i>.</p>

<p>"'Think again, my friends,' said the sacristan, exchanging
his customary look of sanctity for one of deep
cunning and malignity. 'Think again, and decide
quickly. In another minute the arch-priest will enter
the church to perform mass. All the inhabitants of the
village will be pouring in. There is no time to be lost.
Either let me have a third of the treasure, or I shall
swear by all the saints to the arch-priest that I caught
<i>you</i>, Signor Antonio, in the act of robbing the alms-box,
and that the Madonna wrought a miracle before my
very eyes by raising <i>you</i>, Signor Guiseppe, from the
dead in order to chastise the burglar for his sacrilege.'</p>

<p>"'He will not believe thee, thou imp of Satan!'
roared Peppe.</p>

<p>"'We shall see,' rejoined the sacristan, with a
malicious chuckle, and rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>"At this moment the arch-priest entered, attired
in his robes, and all the congregation at his heels.</p>

<p>"'Oh, Signor Arch-priest!' began the sacristan, in
a loud voice, before the assembled multitude, rolling up
his eyes and crossing himself with mock devotion, 'I
have witnessed this morning a miracle with these very
eyes.'</p>

<p>"'A miracle!' exclaimed the arch-priest and all the
congregation in chorus.</p>

<p>"'Ay,' persisted the sacristan; 'a genuine, undeniable
miracle. As I entered the church this morning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
light the candles on the altar, I discovered this burglar
(pointing to me) in the act of robbing the alms-box.
He had just succeeded in extracting all that treasure
that you see on the ground before you, and which was
doubtless all of it placed in the box by our blessed
Lady's own hands for the use of her holy church. For
who else in our little village could have amassed such a
sum, or, having amassed it, would have been willing to
put it all of a heap within the alms-box?</p>

<p>"'Well, Signor Arciprete, just as the sacrilegious
knave was about to count his unhallowed gains, lo! a
miracle, such as these eyes never before beheld, and may
never see again before they close for ever in peace.'</p>

<p>"'Well, well,' said the arch-priest, impatiently.</p>

<p>"'Well, Signor Arciprete mio, will you believe it?
Yon image of our blessed Lady suddenly raised its
arm in a commanding attitude, and with a voice of
ineffable sweetness blended with severity cried out to
yon corpse, or, rather, that man, who <i>was</i> a corpse only
last night, as all good people may recollect, "Corpse!
arise and seize yon sacrilegious ruffian by the scruff of
the neck!" The words were no sooner out of the
blessed image's mouth, when up leapt the corpse from
his bier, and seizing the burglar with an iron grasp,
continued to hold him until vostra Reverenza entered
the church!'</p>

<p>"The arch-priest remained dumbfounded for a time,
not knowing what to say; but just as I was about to
break silence and try to exculpate myself, my voice was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
immediately drowned by the multitude crying out,
'Down with him! down with him! Down with the
thief, the burglar, the heathen! Let him not seek to
exculpate himself with lies. Hear him not; he is
guilty of sacrilege! Down with the Protestant! Blessed
be the holy man who was raised from the dead and the
good sacristan to whose eyes the miracle was vouchsafed!
Down with the Jew, the Protestant, the heretic!
<i>Away</i> with the miscreant! away with him.'</p>

<p>"I saw and heard no more. Hurried away, midst
the hootings and execrations of the crowd, I was flung
into prison, where I have remained ever since the
morning."</p>

<p>There was much in Antonio's story that moved me
to laughter, though not a smile appeared upon the face
of the narrator himself throughout the whole recital.
There was an air of truth, too, about his manner that
left no doubt in my mind that he had retailed the facts
of the case as they had occurred without adding to or
taking from them in the minutest particular.</p>

<p>I was then able to tell him the sequel of the story;
how the arch-priest had put the greater part of the treasure
into the alms-box, and, for the rest, the sum being too
large to enter all of it into the box, he had taken charge
of it, together with the diamond ring, and had designed
the whole sum to be expended for the benefit of the
church.</p>

<p>On hearing this he replied that he had rather that
the money should be disposed of in that way than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
blackleg of a sacristan should get a penny of it. He
said that he was perfectly sure that the arch-priest had
only so disposed of the money from a sincere belief
that it had been miraculously placed in the alms-box,
he himself being the dupe of his own rascally sacristan
to whom he trusted implicitly.</p>

<p>He was of opinion that had he been allowed to
explain himself to the arch-priest, his reverence would
have granted him, if not his proper share of the sum,
at least some portion of it. I promised him that I
would lay his case before the arch-priest, and do what I
could to get him liberated from prison. He thanked
me, and slipping a small coin into the turnkey's hand, I
quitted the cell.</p>

<p>It was now quite dark, so I thought I would make
the best of my way home, where my supper awaited
me. The following morning was rainy, and not being
able to work out of doors, I resolved to call again
upon the arch-priest, and finding him at home, I related
to him my interview with the prisoner and the statement
he gave of the case.</p>

<p>My reverend friend looked thoughtful for a time,
shook his head, and hinted that the prisoner's veracity
might not be depended on.</p>

<p>"However," he added, "the tale seems feasible, and
I desire nothing more than that the prisoner should have
justice. I will probe the matter to the bottom, and if he
has spoken the truth I will get him liberated as soon as
possible, and will moreover give out publicly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
church that what we had erroneously taken for a
miracle was nothing more than a curious combination
of circumstances perfectly natural, though strange, and
that I had been imposed upon by the villainous and
profane lies of my sacristan. It will require time to
prove all this; meanwhile, Antonio must take his trial
at Gennazzano. He left here at five o'clock this
morning."</p>

<p>"So early!" I exclaimed. "I wanted, if possible,
to prevent his going."</p>

<p>"You take great interest in his case," said my
friend.</p>

<p>"I like to see mysteries cleared up as soon
as possible," I replied. "I know that the love of
the marvellous is so great among the ignorant in these
parts, that they prefer persisting to believe in a miracle,
even in the face of facts which explain it away in the
most natural manner possible. This proneness to
attribute to supernatural causes everything that we are
unable to account for on the first glance, and to yield
ourselves up implicitly to the belief of what is irrational,
absurd, improbable, without first weighing thoroughly
the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of the case, is one of the unmistakable
signs of a barbarous and uncultivated intellect, and
ought to be discouraged as a trait unworthy the dignity
of human nature by everyone who has the improvement
and well-being of his fellow creatures at heart."</p>

<p>The arch-priest smiled drily, as if he had taken my
last speech to himself; then, after a pause, he began:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"No Christian man will deny that miracles have
been wrought, or will dare to call in question those of
our blessed Lord or of His saints. If, then, he
acknowledges these, why should he try to combat the
existence of modern miracles, seeing that everything is
possible to the Almighty? What! Shall we limit the
power of the Omnipotent, or dare to measure things
infinite by our finite faculties? It would be the height
of presumption for anyone to maintain that these
things cannot be, or that our Heavenly Father cares
less for His creatures now than he did in the days
of yore."</p>

<p>"No wise man, Christian or otherwise," I replied,
"would deny that any wonder were possible to the
Divine author of the universe, the Great Source of all
things wonderful. Yet science, the gift of God Himself,
mind you, since He in the first place created us with
intellect to see into, in some measure, however darkly,
His wonderful workings, in order that we might be
taught to admire them and thereby come to a more
perfect knowledge of His unspeakable greatness&mdash;science,
I say, reveals to us that our universal Father
rules all nature by means of certain fixed laws, from
which we have no reason to believe that He would turn
aside for a trifle&mdash;to excite mere wonderment among
an ignorant multitude by performing such a conjuring
trick as a bleeding crucifix or weeping Madonna.
Our Lord Himself was chary of His miracles, and when
asked for a sign would often refuse; yet when He did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
perform miracles, they were invariably to do good, and
not to excite wonderment. If many intelligent people
disbelieve in modern miracles, it is because they have
not come within their experience, or that many seeming
miracles they have been able to explain by natural
causes.</p>

<p>"They have been made, moreover, doubly cautious
in receiving hearsay miracles for gospel from the
numerous cases of imposture that have been discovered
among the priesthood in all countries where the Roman
Catholic religion has prevailed. Then, why should
miracles only be wrought in little sequestered villages,
among the ignorant and superstitious, and not in large
towns, in the presence of an intelligent and investigating
population? Why, moreover, should they be
more prevalent in mountainous districts than in any
others? Why? Save that from the topographical
configuration of the country, the inhabitants of mountain
villages are necessarily more shut out from intercommunication
with their kind than the dwellers in more
accessible regions, and consequently cut off from that
interchange of ideas so necessary to the development of
the human intellect.</p>

<p>"Because their minds thus necessarily forced into
one narrow channel till the intelligence borders on that
of the brute, and is kept down to that pitch by a
coarse and monotonous diet, which hard labour enables
them to earn but scantily, and, finally, because by
intermarrying closely among their own narrow population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
they reproduce offspring, if anything, more stunted in
intelligence than themselves&mdash;to say nothing of other
natural influences which help to produce cretinism,
goitre, and deformity&mdash;and thus shutting out from their
poor benighted intellects their last chance of fair play.</p>

<p>"Ignorant by force of circumstances, superstitious
because they are ignorant, naturally discontented, with
a life of hard labour that barely supplies that life's
necessaries, what wonder that the human mind thus
stunted and oppressed by all its surroundings, should
seek an outlet? That that outlet should be one that
held out promises of a better time to come than they
are ever likely to see in their plodding every-day life?</p>

<p>"What wonder that such a one should throw
himself more entirely upon the comforts of the religion
that his village priest holds out to him than one more
contented with his earthly lot, or that, superstitious as
he is ignorant, he should daily hope for some miracle to
be wrought for his own special benefit? Is it too much
to infer that a mind in which faith reigns supreme and
reason is hushed to sleep may be deluded by its senses&mdash;that
it may imagine it sees or hears anything that it
desires to see or hear?</p>

<p>"Is this an irrational solution of the stories so
common of pictures of the Virgin or other saints moving
their eyes or speaking? Then just consider when the
average intelligence of a scanty population is at this ebb,
what temptation this holds out to the priest of the
parish whose office it is to rule his little flock by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
maintaining order and restraining crime, to strike awe
into his congregation and keep alive their fanatical faith
by some pious fraud in the shape of a crucifix that
bleeds by an easy mechanical contrivance, an image of
the Madonna that sheds tears, or a picture that rolls its
eyes!</p>

<p>"These tricks were known to the heathen priests of
antiquity long before the introduction of Christianity,
and have been repeatedly carried out since by the
priests of Rome. It is to the successful delusion of
these poor benighted wretches that the Church of Rome
owes her vaunted laurels. These are your miracle
seers! To these alone do the saints vouchsafe to
perform their wonders! As for the intelligent and
wise, if they go to a church on purpose to see a miracle,
and come away without seeing it, they are told by the
priest that it is because they lack faith, that they do not
go in the proper spirit, that their natures are too
material, that such sights are reserved only for the
faithful, and that few are sufficiently spiritualised to
behold them.</p>

<p>"So you see there is no way of catching a priest
napping. He will always find some hole to creep out
of. Like an eel, he will slip through your fingers at
the very moment that you may think you have got him.
Should any individual be bold enough to force his way
through the wonder-gazing crowd, and publicly demolish
the miracle-working image or picture and reveal to the
devout bystanders the paltry mechanism by which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
have been deluded, people's eyes would at length be
opened, all miracles be liable to suspicion, and reason
at length admitted into some share of man's being.</p>

<p>"But there are difficulties that beset so bold an
expedient. In the first place, a man must be possessed
of more than an ordinary amount of courage to face the
fury of a fanatical mob whom he knows to be ready to
tear him in pieces should he attempt to rob them of
their darling prejudices, or dare to break one chip off
their sacred wood or stone.</p>

<p>"Secondly, the wonder-working image or picture is
generally in an inaccessible place, high up on the wall
or surrounded by railings, to prevent a too close
scrutiny. Thirdly, the miracle often exists merely in
the imaginations of devout believers, without any aid of
mechanism on the part of the priest. In this case, if
any man were daring enough to step forward and openly
to break in pieces the supposed miraculous image or
picture, and, having done so, was unable to detect in
the fragments any trace of machinery or means of
imposture whatever, the fame of the miracle would then
gain ground, and the daring unbeliever be guilty of
sacrilege."</p>

<p>When I had got thus far, my friend the arch-priest
drew himself up and was about to reply in a lengthy
rejoinder, when he was suddenly interrupted by the
servant girl of his household bursting hurriedly into the
room and crying out at the top of her voice, "Oh,
Signor Arciprete, have you heard the news? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
<i>vetturino</i> of the mail has just arrived. He says that the
night before last the mail was stopped on its way to
Rome by a band of brigands, who robbed the
passengers, consisting of six English gentlemen and
others, of everything they had about them. Gold, silver,
and paper money&mdash;quite a heap&mdash;besides some gold
and silver watches, and, among other things, a diamond
ring of great value, belonging to one of the English
gentlemen. The soldiers are on the track of the brigands
already, and a heavy reward is offered to whosoever shall
give such information as shall lead to their discovery.</p>

<p>"Poor Luigi! He says that he himself was robbed
of his silver watch and paper money, amounting to
forty pauls, all he possessed in the world. I do hope
they'll catch the nasty wretches. I myself would see
them executed. <i>Gesu Maria!</i> What hungry wolves!
But I must be off now to tell all the people in the
village, or else that horrid gossip Maria Giovanna will
be before me, and I always like to be first."</p>

<p>So saying, she bounced out of the room, slamming
the door after her, and we were left once more alone.</p>

<p>There was a pause, and my friend was the first to
break silence. The thread of his ideas had been
broken by the girl's sudden entry into the room with
the startling news, so he did not resume his discourse,
but after a while observed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose you see in the wild tale of this girl a
corroboration of the prisoner's statement, and a link in
the chain of evidence."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said I, "it looks like it, does it not?
The heaps of gold and silver, the paper money, the
gold and silver watches, and, moreover, the diamond
ring. It certainly looks as if the mystery were beginning
to clear up."</p>

<p>"Softly, my friend, softly," rejoined the priest, who
still grudged the event to natural causes. "Do not be
rash in jumping at conclusions, for the evidence is not
yet complete. Let us first satisfy ourselves that the
girl's tale is true, for reports get wind about our village&mdash;one
hardly knows how&mdash;without the least vestige of
truth in them. I will speak to the <i>vetturino</i> myself,
and if the tale prove true, or partly true&mdash;for, depend
upon it, the story will have lost nothing in the telling&mdash;need
it do away entirely with the miracle?</p>

<p>"For instance, suppose instead of being a band of a
dozen brigands, it should have been only one brigand,
and that brigand your friend Antonio himself. That he
alone, laden with his treasure, and being attracted by
the light of a candle that he descried through the chinks
of the church door, forced his way into the church to
count over his booty. Supposing this to have been the
case, the miracle may, nevertheless, have occurred
precisely as related to me by the sacristan."</p>

<p>"You are very ingenious," said I, "in suggesting an
improbability in order to support your miracle, but, if
you recollect, the sacristan declared that he caught
Antonio in the act of breaking open the alms-box."</p>

<p>"That may have been a mistake caused by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
excited state of his mind on the occasion. However,
I will see Luigi at once, and learn from his own
lips the true state of the case, for I am as anxious
to get at the truth as you are."</p>

<p>"Then let us lose no time in speaking to him at
once," said I. "The weather is clearing up now, and as
I have nothing better to do, I will accompany you in
your stroll down to his house."</p>

<p>This was agreed on; so, putting on our hats, we
found ourselves once more among the dirty streets,
until we reached the house of the <i>vetturino</i>. Here we
found him in front of his own door, surrounded by a
crowd of eager peasants, who were listening with
avidity to the recital of his adventures.</p>

<p>"<i>Buon giorno, Signor Arciprete</i>," said Luigi,
raising his hat as we approached.</p>

<p>"<i>Buon giorno, Luigi</i>," responded the arch-priest.
"There is a strange tale current in the village about you
and your passengers having been robbed on the high
road. Can it be true."</p>

<p>"Perfectly true, Reverenza," was the reply. "Only
the night before last we were assaulted by at least
a dozen banditti armed to the teeth, and my passengers,
six of whom were English gentlemen, along
with myself."</p>

<p>"Stay," said the arch-priest. "You are perfectly
sure there were a dozen of them?"</p>

<p>"A dozen at the very least, your Reverence, I could
swear."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me," said the arch-priest, "did you see
Antonio the prisoner amongst them."</p>

<p>"Antonio?" inquired the <i>vetturino</i>, in extreme
surprise.</p>

<p>"Ay," replied the arch-priest. "He that hath been
accused of robbing the church and is now at Gennazzano
awaiting his trial. You will have heard the tale by this
time."</p>

<p>"I certainly did hear a wonderful story, Reverenza,
but did not know how far to credit it," replied the
<i>vetturino</i>. "The night was very dark and I could
recognise no faces.</p>

<p>"But, <i>Corpi di Bacco</i>! Antonio! Why I always
considered Antonio as an honest man, a simple
<i>vignauolo</i> who earned his bread by the sweat of his
brow, and whom, for his steady plodding, the saints had
awarded by granting him a better share of this world's
goods than most of his fellows."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," said several bystanders at once, "we all
thought so, too, Signor Arciprete. Still, what we all
saw with our own eyes, only yesterday morning, made
us change our opinion."</p>

<p>The arch-priest looked thoughtful, and then
enquired of Luigi if he knew anything of Peppe, the
man who had been raised from the dead.</p>

<p>"Peppe!" exclaimed the <i>vetturino</i>, laughing, "ay,
do I, and a greater rascal never walked God's earth.
That is why I was so cautious in believing a story in
which Peppe the goatherd was mixed up. I never yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
heard any tale in which he figured but had some
devilry at the bottom of it."</p>

<p>"You do not believe, then, in the miracle?"</p>

<p>"Not upon such testimony," replied Luigi. "I
should believe <i>you</i>, Signor Arciprete, if you had seen it
with your own eyes," he added, respectfully.</p>

<p>"All I can declare is," replied the priest, "that I
saw the man Peppe, apparently dead, and decked out as
a corpse, placed within the church upon his bier, and
the morning after, as I entered the church to say mass, I
saw him as alive as ever again, still in his shroud, and
appearing to dispute the treasure with Antonio. As for
the rest, it was communicated to me by Ricardo, my
sacristan. Do you know Ricardo?"</p>

<p>"I do," replied Luigi, in a tone of deep meaning.</p>

<p>"Well," said the arch-priest, "what do you think of
him?"</p>

<p>"Well, Signor Arciprete," said the <i>vetturino</i>,
hesitatingly, "as he is your sacristan, perhaps you
would not like to hear <i>what</i> I think of him."</p>

<p>"Speak out, man," said the arch-priest. "If I find
him unworthy of his post, I shall discharge him.
Come, now, what do you know about him?"</p>

<p>"Since your Reverence presses me," replied the
<i>vetturino</i>, "I must confess that I have found him to be
just such another scamp as Peppe the goatherd, if not
worse, and, in spite of all his mock piety, I have found
him to be as cunning a knave as I know for miles
round. Grasping as an eagle, wily as a serpent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
withal as poor spirited as a hare, seeking to cover his
knavery with the cloak of religion; imagining that no
one can see through his hypocrisy."</p>

<p>"You surprise me," exclaimed the arch-priest;
"but what proof have you of his knavery?"</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place," replied the <i>vetturino</i>,
"he is in debt with almost every man in the village,
myself among the number, and not in one instance has
he been known to repay what he has borrowed. I have
pressed him over and over again, but he always sneaks
out of it by some lame excuse, even when I know he
has been able to pay me. He wanted to marry my
sister once, because he thought there was a little money
to be had, but when he spoke to my mother about her
dowry, and received for reply that she did not intend
to give her daughter to one who sought her for her
dowry, and that he who would marry her must support
her himself, he very soon slunk off. Not that I'd have
given my consent to such a scarecrow marrying my
sister, even if he <i>had</i> been less grasping. Then, would
you believe it, your Reverence, he actually had the
impudence to insult my sister when he encountered her
alone, as he thought, in the campagna. He little
knew that I was only a short distance behind. I came
upon him unawares in time to overhear part of his
impertinent conversation, and I gave him such a
thrashing as will make him remember Luigi the <i>vetturino</i>
as long as he lives.</p>

<p>"Then, there is no doubt that it was he who picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the pocket of poor old Matteo when he happened to be
drunk; everybody believes that, besides several other
dirty tricks that I will not weary your patience by
relating, though I could if I would. As for cheating at
cards, he is quite an adept, and yet, with all this, he
walks with his eyes hypocritically fixed on the ground,
counting his beads and crossing himself, as if he were a
very saint. But he doesn't take <i>me</i> in, your Reverence,
however he may impose on our simple peasantry, for
when a man is a <i>vetturino</i>, he sees other towns
besides his own, and gets to know people of all sorts.
I have been in Rome, and have picked up a thing or
two."</p>

<p>"Well, enough for the present, Luigi," said the arch-priest.
"I will enquire into this matter; meanwhile I
intend to take a stroll with this gentleman. Till we
meet again," and he waved his hand to the <i>vetturino</i>.</p>

<p>"A rivederla, Signor Arciprete," responded Luigi,
raising his hat respectfully.</p>

<p>"You see now," said I to my friend, as we strolled
together from the narrow streets into one of the main
roads, "that there is some evidence to support my
view of the case. I never did think much of your
sacristan; his face was enough for me, but after the
evidence you have just heard, methinks you would do
well to rid yourself of such an ornament to your church."</p>

<p>"It is odd," replied my friend, "that I never
suspected him of being that sort of character. On the
contrary, I thought him a most exemplary young man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
It is not long ago since he informed me of his ardent
desire to enter holy orders."</p>

<p>"A fine priest he'd make!" said I, laughing.
"The church has no need of him, for there are too
many of his sort among your priesthood already. Not
that he wouldn't be popular," I added, soothingly. "On
the contrary, he would be able to manufacture miracles
by the cart-load, I warrant, in order to satisfy his flock's
thirst for the marvellous. He would probably die in
the odour of sanctity and be canonised after his death."</p>

<p>"My friend, my friend," said the arch-priest, gravely,
"our church is not, as you think, rash in canonising a
man a saint. Our lawsuits are extremely rigid, and
long&mdash;so much so, that many a holy man has been
rejected as a saint on account of the insufficient
evidence of his miracles."</p>

<p>Then he proceeded to enlarge upon the miracles of
the saints of old and all the legendary lore of his
religion, and thus he entertained me until we found
ourselves once more at the door of his house.</p>

<p>"Signor Arciprete," said the aforementioned servant
girl, whom we discovered on the threshold, conversing
with an elderly peasant, "here is a man who wishes to
speak to you in private. He says he has something to
communicate."</p>

<p>"Show him into my study," said the arch-priest.
"I suppose you do not mind my friend being
present?" said he, addressing the man and glancing at
me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Reverenza," said the peasant, shutting the door
of the priest's study behind him, "it was only to bring
you some information concerning the brigands."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed the arch-priest, pricking up his
ears. "Proceed."</p>

<p>"Well, your Reverence," began the peasant, "hearing
that a reward had been offered to anyone able to give
such information as should lead to the discovery of the
brigands, I thought I would make known what
happened to me on the very night of the robbery,
which I hope may prove of some use to the brigand-catchers.</p>

<p>"It was long past midnight when I was returning
from Civitella, having purchased a hog there, which I
was leading along by a string attached to its hind leg,
when in the darkness I heard the sound of many voices,
and upon listening attentively I recognised them as
belonging to the brigands, into whose hands I had
fallen twice before, and I began to be alarmed for my
hog, which I made sure would be seized as a prize, and
accordingly hid myself behind a tree until the whole
band should have passed by. I was near enough to
hear every word they said, but their voices seemed
neither to grow louder nor to grow less.</p>

<p>"At length the moon breaking from behind a cloud,
revealed to me the features of the brigand chief. He
was standing erect whilst the rest of his band were
squatting or lounging around him in a circle. He then
proceeded to harangue them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"I trembled from head to foot, and felt that my only
chance of escaping observation was to continue rooted
to the spot without disturbing the dead leaves that lay
strewn at my feet, but the wretched animal, my companion,
commenced grunting and squealing, as if purposely
to mark my whereabouts, and I made sure every
moment that the brigands would be down upon us both.</p>

<p>"'Hush!' I cried, coaxingly.</p>

<p>"'Grunt,' went the brute, louder than ever.</p>

<p>"'Madonna mia Santissima!' I muttered, crossing
myself, 'preserve a poor man and his pig from the
depredations of these marauders!'</p>

<p>"I know not if our good lady vouchsafed to hear
my prayer, but certain it was that the brigands paid no
attention whatever to either of us, so engrossed did they
all seem with the oration of their chief, every word of
which fell distinctly on my ear in the stillness of the
night, and I must own that the tenor of it surprised me,
for instead of the profane oaths, fiendish laughter, or the
planning of some new daring exploit, as I should have
expected from such men, I now listened to a pious discourse,
filled with godly phrases such as you, Signor
Arciprete, might have used yourself from the pulpit. I
think I can give you almost word for word the discourse
as it ran.</p>

<p>"'My comrades,' he commenced, 'we have for
many years toiled together in an arduous and perilous
profession; at war with society, wresting from the innocent
and good their hard-earned substance to supply our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
own wants, instead of getting our own livelihood
honestly and by the sweat of our brow, as God hath decreed.
Oppressed in our turn by the avengers of our
victims, we are hunted like wolves, and have to take
refuge from our pursuers in the most inaccessible parts
of the mountains, in caves, in forests and such-like
secret places.</p>

<p>"'Rest has departed from our slumbers&mdash;for what
man can rest in the fear that the vigilant myrmidons of
the law with which he has lived at enmity are ever on
his track?</p>

<p>"'Like Ishmael, our hand is against every man, and
every man's hand is against us. This is the lot of the
brigand, as we all know. Born and bred in danger,
nurtured from the breast, not with the milk of human
kindness, but by the blood of his fellow men; his
childish joys, the groans and sufferings of his mutilated
victims; feasting on horrors from his earliest youth, unbridled
and brutal in his appetites, his highest ambition
through life to be a hardier ruffian than his father before
him.</p>

<p>"'Have we not, my friends, committed every sort of
atrocity of which degraded humanity is capable? Nay,
revelled in it, impiously defying that very God whom we
ought humbly and reverently to thank as the Author of
our beings? Let each of us look back upon our past
lives and ask ourselves how we have thanked Almighty
God for his innumerable blessings.</p>

<p>"'How have we repaid His ineffable love and care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
over us? Has it not been by subverting His wise laws,
despising His holy ordinances, brutalising our natures,
even to a degree lower than the very brutes themselves?
My brethren, we may be powerful against the weak and
against the law, yet there is One above us more powerful
than ourselves, to Whom we shall all one day
have to give an account. Let us fight no longer against
God; for what is man when matched against Omnipotence.
Deem it not cowardice, my friends, to relinquish
a life of evil now that your souls have received the light
of truth, but rather thank God for His infinite mercy in
vouchsafing so great a miracle through His Holy
Mother to save our souls from the bottomless pit.</p>

<p>"'I confess that almost from my earliest youth I
never have looked upon religion as aught but priest-craft,
and scoffed at all miracles as tricks of the priesthood to
impose upon the ignorant and simple; but what shall we
say, my brethren, to the miracle we have all so lately
witnessed, or how shall we attempt to explain it away?
Was it not the intervention of the blessed Virgin herself
to scare us&mdash;the impious desecraters of her holy
Church&mdash;from our evil ways? Could anything short of
Divine power have raised the dead at the lonely hour of
midnight within the very church itself, and have struck
such terror into us, the hardy sons of the mountains, who
never yet quailed before mortal man?</p>

<p>"'Tell me, my friends, if in all my wild life, in all our
joint villainies and wicked enterprises, in the very face
of death, if you have ever known me to lack courage before
to-night?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Never, Capitano, never,' cried several voices at
once. 'We know your courage to be undaunted, and
that there is no mortal man that you stand in awe of;
but when it comes to running counter to spirits raised
from the dead, or devils from hell, that is quite another
sort of thing, and a man need be the arch-fiend himself
to be without fear.'</p>

<p>"'Just so,' replied the brigand chief; 'then, since
none of you are able to accuse me with a lack of
human courage, you may know that my exhortation to
you to repent and alter the course of your unholy
lives is not the mere words of a craven soul who fears
the law and seeks to shun the just penalty of his misdeeds,
but those of a repentant sinner miraculously
brought to conversion through the intervention of the
blessed Madonna, whom, in her boundless mercy, she
had deigned to bring to a sense of his wickedness, even
in the very midst of his crimes.</p>

<p>"'Let us turn from our evil ways, oh, my comrades!
Take the advice of a brother sinner, more deeply dyed
in iniquity than any of yourselves, and repent ere it be
too late! What can atone for all our past wickedness
save the utter renouncement of our evil ways, a life of
rigid penance and the entire devotion of ourselves to
God? Marvel not, then, my comrades in wickedness,
that you hear the man once your chief and foremost in
wrong, exhort you to throw down your arms, divest
yourselves of your trappings, and don the holy convent
garb, in order that by a life of fasting and prayer you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
may endeavour to open up a communication with
Heaven, and wrest your souls from the hands of the
Devil. I myself will set you the example.</p>

<p>"'As I have been the first to incite you to evil, so
will I be the first to exhort you to repentance. Follow
me, all ye that have a mind to save your souls. Yet I
no longer command, but entreat you for your own good,
for I aspire no longer to be your chief, but to live
humbly as your fellow labourer in Christ, to whom be
all honour and glory, now and for evermore. Amen.'</p>

<p>"As the chief brigand terminated his harangue the
pale grey of the morning sky lighted up the faces of the
whole band, so that I could now distinguish the features
of each individual and the various expressions of their
countenances. Several appeared deeply affected, with
tears of repentance standing in their eyes, others sullen
and obdurate. Some with a look of vacant astonishment,
others scowling and suspicious, or with a suppressed
grin.</p>

<p>"Their chief's harangue seemed to call for a reply,
and there was a silence of some minutes, during which
period the members of the band appeared debating
among themselves by means of winking and nudging
as to what their reply should be, and who should take
it upon himself to speak for the rest. I observed that
they looked towards a sturdy brigand, whom next to
their chief they honoured with the deepest veneration.
To him they turned as the mouthpiece of the gang, and
seemed to intimate that they would abide by his decision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"This man, who appeared wrapt in thought, finding
himself thus appealed to, and feeling that he represented
the sentiments of the whole band, at length addressed
his chief in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Signor Capitano, we are ready as ever to follow
you to the very jaws of death, according to our oath.
We have served you long and faithfully in all your
deeds of daring and crime, and we will not abandon
you now in your change of sentiment, knowing, as we
do, that you are still the same brave and generous man
as ever, and as such will always remain, in whatever
capacity, whether as the lawless brigand of the mountains,
or as a holy monk in the retirement of the convent
cell; therefore, in the presence of the whole band I
repeat my former vows of fidelity and friendship, and
reiterate my protestations of following you through life,
to the utmost ends of the earth, if need be. The discipline
of our monastic life will be merely the exchanging
one life of hardships for another no less hard,
therefore we cannot be charged with cowardice or
idleness, since there are duties before us that will call
forth all the courage and endurance of our natures.</p>

<p>"'As for learning and psalm-singing, it has never
been exactly my speciality; nevertheless, I quite agree
with you, Captain, that the life we have been in the
habit of leading for years past is not the best to suit
us for Heaven, and I am not ashamed to say that I have
long had qualms of conscience for my past misdeeds,
and had resolved upon repentance at some future period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
but never did I look back upon the past with such
horror and remorse as at the present moment, having
now been brought to a thorough knowledge of my crimes
and of the bountiful mercy of our blessed Lady to us
miserable sinners, as shown in the undoubted miracle
that we all so clearly witnessed.</p>

<p>"'After having received so great a proof of the blessed
Virgin's love and care for us, would it not be the blackest
ingratitude to continue in mortal sin? Would it not be
the most egregious folly as well, after having had Divine
warning to alter our lives, still to persist in preferring
death and hell to the sublime promises held out to the
good?</p>

<p>"'Why longer delay, then, my friends? Think of
your precious souls, and repent while there is still
breath left in your bodies. It may not be long ere we
shall be captured and executed. How shall we pass
our last moments on earth, or how brook the vengeance
of a just God with all our crimes upon our heads?</p>

<p>"'Enough, then, of pusillanimous disbelief and impotent
struggling against Divine will. Let us hasten to
the nearest convent, confess our sins, then, with a clean
breast and humble spirit, endeavour to atone for the
past by a life of penitence and prayer, that we may
fearlessly meet our end as men and Christians.'</p>

<p>"This exhortation was universally applauded, and
as every man is governed by the public opinion of the
little circle wherein he lives and moves, so even those
who had shown themselves obdurate and suspicious felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
themselves forced to yield to the overwhelming tide of
changed opinion, feeling ashamed of being left in the
minority.</p>

<p>"The chief, doffing his hat, fell upon his knees and
thanked the Most High for his conversion and that of
his whole band, in which prayer all the rest reverently
joined. Then rising from their knees, but with heads
still uncovered, they walked on towards the convent,
singing an 'Ave Maria,' by the way.</p>

<p>"I did not know what to make of all this, for as yet
I had heard nothing of the miracle, but I had hardly
reached home safely with my pig, when I heard from
almost every mouth in the village of the great miracle
wrought on the night of the robbery."</p>

<p>The peasant having concluded his narrative, was
dismissed with an assurance from the arch-priest that
should his revelation lead to the capture of the brigands
he would be duly rewarded. Nevertheless, he informed
him that he was not the person to apply to, and that he
should mention the affair to the authorities.</p>

<p>Being left once more alone with my friend, I asked
him what he thought of the man's tale, and whether or
no it corroborated the statements made by Luigi and
Antonio. All three witnesses bore testimony to a
plurality of brigands, which seemed to me completely to
overthrow my worthy friend's hypothesis as to there
being only one brigand.</p>

<p>I confess, though, I was still puzzled by the peasant's
wonderful story. I could hardly bring myself to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
in the utter and simultaneous conversion of a whole
band of brigands, even though they <i>had</i> been terrified
and thwarted for a moment in their crimes by an apparent
miracle, and yet what object could the man have
had in inventing such a lie, knowing, as he must have
done, that he was not entitled to the reward until after
the capture of the brigands.</p>

<p>My friend the priest suggested that possibly he might
have been fool enough to expect payment beforehand,
and that he had concocted this fable on the strength of it.
The man was simple enough, it is true, but there was an
air of truth about the manner in which he told his tale that
induced me to give credit to it, strange though it appeared.</p>

<p>In any case, I knew that the truth or falsity of the
man's statement would soon be made manifest, for the
brigand-catchers, once sent off in the direction indicated
by the peasant, would not fail to call at the convent and
inquire if the brigands were taking shelter there, in
which case the monks would be forced to deliver up
their charge into the hands of justice. As it happened,
the brigand-catchers had already started in search of
their prey, though in quite an opposite direction.</p>

<p>But let us return to our landlady, who had been impatiently
awaiting me, having now prepared my noon-day
meal some time.</p>

<p>"The signor is late to-day," she said, as I entered.
"I fear he will find the macaroni cold."</p>

<p>"No matter," I replied. "I have a good appetite,
from having been very busy all the morning."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"The signor has been busy&mdash;yes? And yet I notice
that he left all his painting tools at home," observed the
landlady.</p>

<p>"True, my good woman," I replied. "The morning
being rainy, I was prevented from painting out-of-doors,
but I have been very busy, nevertheless."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Signor," she exclaimed, "what could have
occupied you so much as to forget your dinner, if I may
be permitted to ask?"</p>

<p>I expected this question, knowing that my hostess
inherited the vice of curiosity, in common with the rest
of her sex, in a marked degree.</p>

<p>"How was I occupied?" I repeated. "Why, how
else than by searching to the bottom that confounded
miracle you were so full of all yesterday and the day
before."</p>

<p>"Oh, Signor, how you talk!" exclaimed my hostess,
horrified. "What! do you mean to say that the
Blessed Virgin has not wrought among us the greatest
miracle ever heard of in these parts?"</p>

<p>"Well, if this is one of the greatest," I replied, "I
should advise her to give up miracles for the future,
for she is no hand at them."</p>

<p>"How say you, Signor?" cried the landlady,
shocked at my levity, and crossing herself again and
again. "Oh, you Protestants believe in nothing!
What! Is it not a great miracle to raise the dead?"</p>

<p>"It would be, if it were true," I interrupted.</p>

<p>"If it were true!" she repeated. "How should it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
not be true? Have you not heard that the arch-priest
himself believes it, that all the village believes it, that
the good Ricardo the sacristan was an eye-witness of the
miracle?"</p>

<p>"I must have better testimony than his in order to
believe in the miraculous character of the story you
related to me. However, I have since looked into the
case myself and find it to be a gross piece of imposture."</p>

<p>"<i>Imposture!</i>" cried the hostess. "Impossible!
Who has been imposing&mdash;his reverence, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"No," I said; "the arch-priest was only one of the
dupes. His rascal of a sacristan was at the bottom of
all the mischief. That scoundrel Peppe, too, was
another prominent actor in the farce."</p>

<p>"What do I hear?" exclaimed my landlady; "the
pious Ricardo and the holy Peppe called 'rascal' and
'scoundrel.' You surely mistake their characters."</p>

<p>"We are all liable to make mistakes sometimes,"
said I; "but I will hope, for their own sakes, that they
are not as black as they appear."</p>

<p>"You mystify me, Signor," she replied; "but I am
sure you must be labouring under a gross mistake, for as
a proof of Peppe's being a holy man, he has been doing
nothing but miracles since he was raised from the dead."</p>

<p>"What is that you say?" cried I, pricking up my
ears.</p>

<p>"Why, Signor, you must know that as soon as
Peppe left the church on the morning of the miracle
he was followed by a great crowd of the faithful."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of the curious and the idle, you mean," I
observed, interrupting her. "Well, proceed."</p>

<p>"Who followed him to the door of his house," she
continued; "and as divers of them were labouring
under sore diseases, they besought him to touch them
that they might be healed. Well, very many of them
went away cured; others, he said, he was unable to cure
on account of their want of faith."</p>

<p>"The artful dog!" said I, smiling. "Now, I'll be
bound to say he made all those who imagined themselves
cured pay him well."</p>

<p>"Oh, they all gave him something, of course, from
a <i>baiocco</i> upwards, according to their means. They
tell me the worthy man has made a heap of money by
his miraculous touch."</p>

<p>"Miraculous humbug!" I exclaimed, half-amused
and half-angry at the success of such a vagabond.</p>

<p>"<i>Humbug!</i> say you still?" cried my hostess.
"How can it be humbug, if he really <i>has</i> cured the sick?"</p>

<p>"Come now," said I; "perhaps you will oblige me
with a list of the diseases that this new saint professes
to have cured."</p>

<p>"Willingly," she replied.</p>

<p>"In the first case, there is old Margherita, who lives
at the bottom of the dell, and has been suffering much
from nervous headaches; he but touched her forehead,
and she walked away declaring herself cured. Then there
was poor old Carluccio, who goes about begging from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
one place to another. He suffered much from rheumatism;
but having been touched by Peppe on the parts
affected, he immediately pronounced himself much
better, if not quite cured. Then the girl Lucia, who
lives half-way down the hill, and who used to suffer
from the jumps, she likewise has not complained since.
Then, again, Pietro, the vignauolo, who was suffering
from stomach-ache, felt himself considerably better
some few hours after he had been touched by Peppe.
Brigida, the daughter of old Angeluccio, has for some
time been the victim of a deep melancholy. Since she
received the magic touch she has done nothing but
laugh and sing, Giacomuccio, the idiot boy, complained
of loss of appetite, but after Peppe had touched him
he went home and ate up all the <i>maritozza</i> in the house.
Then the number of children he has cured is something
fabulous; at least, so their parents say."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my good woman," said I; "but these
are all trifles. Can you give me no great cure that he
has effected, such as giving sight to the blind, causing
the lame to walk, the dumb to speak, the deaf to hear,
and the like?"</p>

<p>"One blind man came to be cured," replied my
hostess; "but he, so Peppe said, had not sufficient
faith, so of course no cure could be effected. It was
the same with a cripple who had a withered arm, a man
who had the small-pox, as well as several others. He
said he could do nothing with them, as they were wanting
in faith."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought as much," said I. "All those whom he
could not induce to believe were cured, he sent away as
not having sufficient faith&mdash;the wily rascal! Now, my
good woman, I really <i>do</i> wonder at your placing faith
in such trash. If you knew as much about Peppe's
character as I do, you would very soon cease to look
upon him as a saint. Besides, what are the diseases
you tell me he has cured? Headaches, jumps, nervousness,
low spirits, want of appetite, etc.&mdash;trifles all of
them.</p>

<p>"He was supposed by all to have been miraculously
raised from the dead, and they therefore concluded
that he must have been a holy man, for such a miracle
ever to have been wrought upon him, and being so
esteemed, they at once jumped at the conclusion that he
was gifted with power to work miracles. Accordingly,
all the scum of the village turns out and follows him,
placing implicit faith in his power to cure them of their
half imaginary complaints. They receive his touch, pay
their money, and their imagination worked upon, they
fancy themselves healed. This is the secret of all his
boasted success, for you say yourself that in all those
cases that were worth healing he signally failed."</p>

<p>"Be that as it may, Signor," replied the woman,
"you will hardly pretend to account for the miracle
wrought upon Peppe himself in that manner. How
could a man be raised from the dead by imagination? I
don't see how."</p>

<p>"You don't? Then I will tell you; listen."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>I here proceeded to retail the account of Peppe's
feigned decease in order to escape paying his debt of
three pauls; the entrance of the brigands into the
church with the spoil, since proved to have been robbed
from six English travellers and others who were making
their way towards Rome on that very night; the
dividing of the spoil upon the altar, and the diamond
ring that remained over, with which one of the brigands
dexterously succeeded in startling Peppe out of the
sleep into which he had fallen, by hitting him on the
nose, and finally, the confusion of the brigands
at the sight of what they supposed to be a resuscitated
corpse.</p>

<p>I also related how they had abandoned the treasure
in their flight, and how Peppe, taking advantage of his
position, proceeded to gather together the said treasure,
intending to keep it all for himself. How Antonio at
this moment burst from his hiding place in the confessional,
whither he had resorted in order to satisfy himself
whether his friend's death were genuine or spurious.
How both of them disputed the treasure, how they
agreed to divide it equally, and how the diamond ring
became a bone of contention. How they were surprised
by the sacristan early the next morning. The
sacristan's avarice, revenge, and hypocrisy. I dilated
on the story, not omitting the minutest particular,
and winding up with the subsequent conversion of the
brigands, and letting her know upon what authority I
had come to the knowledge of these facts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The discomfiture of my hostess at hearing her darling
miracle explained away by natural causes, and those, too,
of so ridiculous a nature, was truly pitiable. I believe, in
her heart, she wished that I had never put up at her inn,
so that I might not have dispelled the sweet illusion.</p>

<p>Not many days after my hostess had become convinced
of the spuriousness of her once cherished miracle,
the brigand-catchers returned after their fruitless search,
but being put upon the right scent immediately on their
return, they set off at once to the convent, where they
commanded the monks, in the name of the law, to deliver
up the prisoners. It was, however, too late. The
brigands in the meantime had written a full confession of
their crime to the Pope, with an account of the miracle
and of their sudden determination, in consequence, of
leading holy lives for the future, and had received from
His Holiness pardon and absolution, on condition that
they should follow out their virtuous intentions.</p>

<p>The document, with the pontifical seal affixed to it,
was placed into the hands of these emissaries of the
law, who had now nothing to do but to retire. The
brigands had been transformed into monks; so far no
one had anything to say but the six English travellers,
the victims in the late robbery, and who had lost no
time on their arrival in Rome in informing the government
of their loss, and urging the immediate capture of
the brigands; having heard of the extraordinary turn
the affair had taken, now impatiently demanded their
money back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Believers in the late miracle now grew scarcer and
scarcer every day, the eyes of the most obstinate being
now open to conviction by overwhelming evidence.
Peppe had lost his prestige as a saint, and the headaches,
jumps, fits of melancholy, loss of appetite, and
other small evils of which his patients had thought
themselves miraculously cured, came back again as before
to the indignant faithful, who, armed, in a body
laid siege to the house of the "soi-disant" saint, vowing
to burn his dwelling over his head, if he refused to
give back to each the money that under false pretences
he had extorted.</p>

<p>There is no knowing what an infuriated Italian mob
may not be guilty of perpetrating in the height of its
fury; but let its rage be once drawn aside by some
novel excitement or emotion, its fury will evaporate,
expending its force through another channel. It might
have gone hard with Peppe, if a trifling incident had
not served to avert the fury of the mob when at its
climax. This was the arrival of the diligence with the
six Englishmen, whose pecuniary losses we have before
alluded to, and who have arrived to claim their money
from the arch-priest.</p>

<p>Trifling as this incident was, it proved sufficient to
induce the inhabitants of this sequestered village to
abandon their purpose, and their curiosity now being
raised to its height, they relinquished their victim for a
time, in order to have a good stare at the six illustrious
strangers who had fallen a prey to the brigands, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Peppe, taking advantage of the general confusion,
made his escape from the back door of his hut, and
was soon lost to view in the thick grove of olive trees
that flanked the slopes of the hill.</p>

<p>My story now draws towards a close. The money
was returned to the owners, who were received with
courtesy by the arch-priest, from whose very lips they
heard a detailed account of the late miracle, and so
delighted were they with the simplicity and urbanity of
their new acquaintance, that they each made him a
handsome present out of the money restored to them,
for the benefit of his church, and perhaps as a slight
compensation for the dissatisfaction he must have felt
at the miracle not proving genuine.</p>

<p>The diamond ring likewise fell to the lot of the
arch-priest, with the full permission from the donor to
dispose of it as he might think fit, and after an exchange
of compliments and civilities, the Englishmen took
their departure.</p>

<p>The duplicity and avarice of the sacristan having
now fairly come to light, he was dismissed, and another
chosen to supply his place. Meanwhile the trial of
Antonio was going on in the township of Gennazzano.
Being summoned to appear as a witness, I was forced to
go, and had the satisfaction of being mainly instrumental
in the acquittal of my friend, who returned to his
native village, where on his arrival he was carried in
triumph over the heads of the cheering populace.</p>

<p>The sum presented to the arch-priest, together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the diamond ring, which had been taken to Rome to be
estimated and converted into money, was expended by
our pastor in alleviating the sufferings of the poor
amongst his flock, after which there remained a surplus
sufficient to purchase two silver candlesticks for the
altar of San Rocco, the protecting saint of the village.</p>

<p>Peppe had judiciously hidden himself in the mountains
until the fury of his patients had considerably
abated, but Antonio discovering him one day, renewed
his claim to the three pauls. I forget the excuse he
made on this occasion, but I know for a certainty that
the debt was never repaid during the whole of my stay
in that part of the country.</p>

<p>Some months passed over without anything worthy of
record, but the sequel of this narrative is to come. A
friar, unknown to the inhabitants of our village,
appeared one Sunday morning to perform mass in the
Church of San Rocco. His shaven crown, bronzed skin,
and high aquiline features made him an object of intense
veneration among the devout congregation, as being
unmistakable signs of a pure and austere life. He was
a man of middle age, tall, and well knit, his beard on
the verge of turning grey. The features were worn, but
energetic, yet a physiognomist might have observed that
the eyes were somewhat small in comparison with the
rest of the face and moved rather too rapidly and
furtively from left to right than was strictly necessary to
complete the physiognomy of one whose life had been
completely devoted to religious contemplation. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
arrival had created a sensation in the village, and many
who had never confessed from one year's end to the
other, impelled by curiosity, flocked to the church that
day to confess to the stranger monk, imagining, no
doubt, that the absolution of one from afar and
unknown in the villages was more valid than that of the
arch-priest or any more familiar prelate.</p>

<p>Familiarity breeds contempt, as we all know,
therefore we so often find that Roman Catholics prefer
confessing to some priest or friar that they meet for the
first time, and are not likely to meet again, rather than
to their parish priest, to whom the most secret thought
of their inner lives is already known.</p>

<p>Among those who flocked to confess to the stranger
monk, whose majestic bearing had impressed everyone
with his sanctity, were our two friends Antonio and
Peppe, who, having neither of them confessed for a very
long time, sought this opportunity of disburdening their
souls of those sins they were ashamed of confessing to a
priest of their own native village.</p>

<p>Antonio, to whom I am indebted for the sequel of
this tale, declared to me that he experienced a thrill he
was unable to account for as the friar entered the
confessional; but setting this down to nervousness at
not having confessed for so long, he endeavoured to
concentrate his thoughts, and began what is called a
"general confession," commencing with the sins of his
earliest childhood down to those of recent date.</p>

<p>Fancying that he might have been guilty of avarice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
in pressing too hardly on his friend for the debt of the
three pauls and of sacrilege in having hidden all night in
the confessional, and afterwards quarrelling with his
friend over the treasure within the very church itself, it
occurred to him to relate the whole circumstance to the
father confessor, not omitting the entry of the brigands
and their subsequent fright at what they supposed to be
the sudden resurrection of one from the dead.</p>

<p>Now, Antonio during the whole of this confession
had his eyes fixed upon the countenance of his
confessor, which he could see distinctly through the
grating. It struck him from the first that the features
of the monk were familiar to him, yet he could not
call to mind where or under what circumstances he
had seen them before. He had been racking his brain
for some time past in order to recollect where he had
ever met him, but to no purpose.</p>

<p>He observed that when he began enumerating all
the peccadilloes of his early years the confessor evinced
the utmost indifference, yawning every now and then,
and not deigning a reply; but as soon as he began to
talk about the miracle and the treasure abandoned by
the brigands in their fright, he immediately pricked up
his ears and changed colour.</p>

<p>"Eh, what?" he cried, suddenly waking out of a
doze. "Just oblige me by beginning that again, will
you?"</p>

<p>Antonio, though somewhat surprised at the monk's
abrupt change of manner, nevertheless set it down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the natural interest that so extraordinary a tale inspired,
and recommenced his story, detailing nicely every
circumstance, especially the feigned death of Peppe;
with an exact description of his own feelings at the time.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Peppe, being in church, and
seeing his friend on his knees at the confessional,
thought he could do no less than confess likewise, so,
falling on his knees on the opposite side to his friend,
he prepared to pour out his soul through the opposite
grating, into the left ear of the father confessor, as
soon as his friend should have risen from his knees.</p>

<p>Antonio at length having finished, and received
absolution, remained a moment or two in prayer, whilst
Peppe took his turn. Whatever the subject of Peppe's
confession might have been, it had an extraordinary effect
upon the monk. He became visibly agitated, and the
muscles of his face twitched nervously.</p>

<p>"Then it wasn't a miracle, after all," he gasped,
throwing himself back, while something strongly
resembling an oath rose to his lips, but was instantly
stifled. His bronzed features had become livid, and
hastily giving his absolution, he hurried from the
confessional.</p>

<p>Our two friends had remained behind the rest of the
congregation, and on rising from their knees and finding
themselves alone in the church, each advanced towards
the other in a spirit of Christian forgiveness, and shook
his friend warmly by the hand, the subject of the three
pauls being dropped on this occasion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"By the way, Peppe," said Antonio, after a short
interchange of genial conversation, "did you ever set
eyes on that confessor before, think you?"</p>

<p>"Well, now you mention it, friend Antonio, his
features <i>do</i> seem familiar to me, yet I can't call to
mind where I have seen him," answered Peppe.</p>

<p>"Ah!" suddenly ejaculated Antonio, "I have it.
If that monk is not the head brigand whom you so
miraculously scared away by rising from the dead, may
I be&mdash;shot."</p>

<p>"<i>Per Baccounaccio!</i> friend Antonio, you're right,"
exclaimed his friend; "it <i>is</i> the very same. I thought
I knew him all the while. Well this is strange; and
we have been confessing to a brigand chief!"</p>

<p>"True," said Antonio; "but of course you have
heard that in consequence of the supposed miracle, he
and the rest of his band became converted and took
holy vows, having received a full pardon from the Pope
for their past misdeeds. He now performs mass, and
therefore his absolution is worth just as much as that
of any other ecclesiastic."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I've no doubt," replied Peppe; "but, I
say, Anthony, if you had but noticed how uncommonly
interested he became in the middle of my confession!
That was because I confessed to him the trick I played
upon you, old friend, that night. You remember, eh?
Ha! ha! Well, as soon as I began to talk about
jumping up from the dead, and how the brigands
scampered away helter-skelter, leaving their treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
behind them in their flight, I noticed him change
colour, and he grew impatient to know more. I thought
it strange that he should appear to take such interest in
the matter. Now I can account for his look of remorse
that puzzled me so before. He is angry with himself at
being frightened into turning monk by a sham miracle."</p>

<p>"I, too, noticed the very same thing, friend Peppe,"
said Antonio, "when I likewise confessed the same
story. I'll lay my life that he now repents him of
having turned monk. Perhaps he suspected that we
recognised him, and that was the reason he hastened
away so after confession. I wonder where he is now?"</p>

<p>The mysterious monk had disappeared; so had the
two silver candlesticks on the altar. Extraordinary
coincidence! Had they also vanished by a miracle?</p>

<p>They were on the altar when our two friends went
to confess, as both of them declared. Perhaps the new
sacristan had taken them away to clean after the departure
of the congregation.</p>

<p>No; the sacristan was questioned, he knew naught
but that they were still on the altar. The affair caused
much gossip and surmise, and much time was lost in
loud talking and angry gesticulations. The arch-priest at
length appeared on the spot, and our two friends
Antonio and Peppe communicated to him their suspicions&mdash;viz.,
that the unknown friar, whom both of
them recognised to be no other than the brigand chief
himself, had purloined the silver candlesticks immediately
after confession, and made his escape into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
mountains. Search was now made for the thief, but the
day was already far spent and the monk had had ample
time to reach the convent before his pursuers thought
of going in search of him.</p>

<p>On the following day the arch-priest called at the
convent in person, acquainted the monks there with his
loss, and stated his suspicions. He was informed by
them that the band of brigands who had only lately
become converted and had entered their order, and
who, up to the present time, had shown themselves
most exemplary in conduct, to the great surprise of their
brother monks, had suddenly decamped in the dead of
night, no one knew how. They had evidently resumed
their former profession, as they had left their cassocks
behind them, and their arms, which had been hung up
in the chapel as trophies of their conversion, had been
removed.</p>

<p>The affair of the silver candlesticks was unknown to
the rest of the order, but shortly afterwards a silversmith
in Rome, to whose shop a handsome pair of silver
candlesticks was brought for sale, having some scruples
at receiving stolen goods, and distrusting much the appearance
of the person who brought them, sent secretly
to the police, who took in charge the suspected party.
Now it happened about that time in the vicinity of
Rome, that a certain band of brigands had been guilty
of the most fearful outrages. The police were already
on their track, and the capture of the suspected vendor
of stolen goods subsequently led to the discovery of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
whole band, which was soon identified as the same which
had once received the Pope's pardon and had entered
into holy orders. They were accordingly tried, condemned,
and executed on the summit of the fort of St.
Angelo, which is built on the ruins of the ancient tomb
of Hadrian, on the banks of the Tiber.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By the time our artist had finished his story, and
received Helen's warm eulogium on the same, the
sitting had already come to an end. Dame Hearty
now knocked at the door to ask if her daughter could
be spared, as she found that she really could not go
through her household duties without her.</p>

<p>"Just one moment," said McGuilp; "there, Helen,
just place yourself once more as you were, and I shall
have finished with you for the day. Just one more
touch."</p>

<p>The artist then began working rapidly for some ten
minutes, as if his life were at stake, when suddenly
throwing himself back in his chair, as if exhausted after
some stupendous effort, he exclaimed: "There now!"</p>

<p>These magical words were the signal for Helen's
liberation, and now both mother and daughter placed
themselves behind the artist's chair and proceeded to
criticise his work.</p>

<p>"Oh my! what a love of a pictur'!" exclaimed
Dame Hearty; "and how exactly like our Helen. Oh,
if ever! Well I never! I do declare," etc.</p>

<p>"And how you have improved it this sitting! Why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
last time I thought there was no more to do to it, but
now it is life itself."</p>

<p>"You flatter me, Helen," said McGuilp; "for I
assure you that the portrait is still in a most crude and
unfinished state."</p>

<p>"How say you?&mdash;still unfinished?" cried Helen.
"Well, if you go on at that rate, by next sitting I shall
expect to hear it speak."</p>

<p>"Come, Helen," said her mother, "we must be off,
for we have no time to lose. Another time, when we
have less to do, I shall be most happy to let you assist
the gentleman to finish his pictur'," and curtseying to
McGuilp, she led her daughter out of the room, while
the painter was left to the uninspired operations of
cleaning his palette and brushes, and putting his studio
in order previous to joining the other members of
the club.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>The Waxen Image.&mdash;The Hostess's Story.</h3>

<p>We have alluded before the commencement of our
late story to a clapping of hands proceeding from the
club-room, announcing the termination of some tale
from our hostess.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the tale of our landlady
had come to an end previous to the commencement
of our artist's narrative. Let us entreat our reader,
then, to take a retrospect glance, and imagine himself
seated in the club-room, in the company of its worthy
members and our buxom hostess, whilst the painter was
deeply absorbed in his portrait of the fair Helen.</p>

<p>Dame Hearty, after continued pressing, and some
diffidence on her part, seemed finally to be collecting
her ideas, which process was performed by casting down
her eyes and toying with the corners of her apron;
then as if suddenly inspired, she abruptly smoothed
down her apron on her lap, and dovetailing the fingers
of each ruddy hand within those of the other, she
hemmed once or twice and proceeded in the following
strain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>When I was a girl, gentlemen, about the age of
my Helen, I was just such another as she, though I
dare say you would hardly believe it, to look at me now;
but ask my good man and he'll tell you the same. Look
at my Helen, and you will see what your humble
servant was at her age. I had the same rosy cheeks,
like two ripe apples, the same laughing blue eyes and
sunny hair, and as for spirits, why, Lord bless you, the
dear child ain't nothing to what her mother was at her
age.</p>

<p>Well, gentlemen, I was always for gaming and
romping, and folks would say that there wasn't a lass
like Molly Sykes for miles round. In fact, I used to be
called the pride of the village, though I say it, that
shouldn't. At the time I speak of, I was at the village
school, and there was hardly a young man in the village
that did not come a courtin' after me, but I paid no
attention to none of them, as I had been attached
from childhood to my Jack, then a spruce lad of some
eighteen summers, but I laughed and joked with all,
so I was always popular.</p>

<p>The only school friend I ever had was a young
girl about my own age&mdash;an orphan, one Claribel Falkland,
of an extremely delicate and sensitive nature, the
sweetest temper in the world, and of a beauty which
in my heart I felt surpassed my own, for it was more the
beauty of a high-born lady. I see before me now her
pale oval face with her large lustrous hazel eyes, her
smooth dark nut-brown hair, and her slim graceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
figure which seemed to glide rather than walk about. I
recollect, too, her low soft voice that had music in the
very tone of it, and her sweet look radiant with the
innocence of her heart. I know not how two beings
of such opposite temperaments should ever have become
such fast friends, for Claribel was pensive and melancholy,
and of a studious turn, poring over every book
she could get hold of, whilst I, on the contrary, was a
perfect hoyden, always laughing and playing the fool
when I ought to have been at work.</p>

<p>However strange it may appear, it is certain that
a sympathy stronger than that generally found between
two sisters grew up between us. But let me pass on to
describe certain peculiarities in the constitution of my
young school friend. In the first place, she had been
from childhood a sleep walker, a phenomenon that I
soon discovered, for poor Claribel being an orphan and
having no home of her own, used to live with us, and
we two always slept together.</p>

<p>At first this peculiarity gave me no little alarm,
as she would often rise in the middle of the night,
light a candle and wander all over the house, and I
was afraid that some night she would set the house
on fire.</p>

<p>However, no accident ever occurred, and to my
surprise I found that she seemed just as cautious in her
sleep as if she had been in her waking state, always
shading the flame with her hand and using such extreme
caution when passing near the curtains or anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
else at all likely to catch fire, that I used to doubt
sometimes if she really could be asleep.</p>

<p>Being warned by the doctor never to address her or
touch her whilst in this state, lest the shock should be
too great for her, I, at first, used to follow her with my
eyes about the room, and if she left the chamber, I
generally used to rise and follow softly after, at some
distance, lest an accident should befall her. But finding
soon that she was just as certain of her footing in her
sleep as in her waking moments, I began to abandon my
fears, and thought no more of this peculiarity.</p>

<p>Indeed, as she was in the habit of rising every
other night, I soon felt far too sleepy to trouble myself
about her. But soon this strange power in her began
to develop itself, and to take a stranger and more
interesting form.</p>

<p>She would now get up at night, sit herself down at
a table, take pen, ink, and paper, and fill sheet after
sheet with close writing and elegant composition. This
was particularly the case if she had left a task uncompleted
during the day. In the morning it was sure to
be found finished, and generally better done than if it
had been accomplished during her hours of waking;
nor was she herself conscious of it until she examined
her exercise the next morning.</p>

<p>If I perchance should have an uncompleted task on
hand, she would invariably finish mine before her own.
But this phenomenon in my young friend, however
strange and unaccountable it may seem, sinks into utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
insignificance before a far more terrible one which I am
now about to describe.</p>

<p>You may think I exaggerate, gentlemen, or that it
was the effect of my own over-wrought fancy, produced
by sleepless nights of watching over my young friend,
but there are witnesses living yet who saw what I saw,
and who are ready to give their testimony. The doctor
of this village, together with his assistant, the rector,
and two women living close by, are among these I
speak of, besides others. Let them speak for themselves
if you will not believe my word.</p>

<p>The phenomenon to which I have above alluded
was the power, if I may so call it, of dividing herself in
two, or becoming two separate beings; that is to say, of
making a duplicate of herself. This extraordinary and
fearful gift had evidently been noticed by others before
it fell under my own observation, since for a long time
previous to seeing it myself it was reported throughout
the village that Claribel Falkland had appeared in two
places at the same time.</p>

<p>To this, however, as to all other village gossip, I
paid no attention, knowing well how trifles get
exaggerated after passing through many mouths, and
how sometimes reports are circulated without an atom
of truth for their foundation. I can only tell you,
however, gentlemen, what I saw with my own eyes,
believe it, or not, as you will. One morning, then,
after returning home from school, Claribel having been
unable to attend from some slight indisposition, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
entered the room suddenly where my friend was seated.
I remember, too, that I had never felt in better health
in all my life, when there, to my utter consternation, was
not only my friend, seated as was her wont, in an easy
chair, with her head resting on her hand, but another
figure, the exact counterpart of herself, a duplicate
Claribel, leaning over the back of her arm-chair, exactly
in the same position as my friend happened to be at
the time.</p>

<p>I remained at the door, my eyes and mouth wide
open, in mute horror, unable to advance a step or utter
an exclamation, until my friend, looking up and inquiring
the reason of my surprise, the figure behind the chair
instantly vanished. I then proceeded to relate to her
the vision, which she, however, smiled at and affected to
treat as a temporary delusion on my part, the result of
indigestion or disordered state of my nerves. I persisted
that I was in the most perfect health, and that I
had seen what I chose to style her "double."</p>

<p>She declared to me that she herself had not been
conscious of it, and that, therefore, whatever I might
say to the contrary, it <i>was</i> a delusion. She answered
even with some irritability&mdash;very unusual to her&mdash;which
made me think that she had long been aware of
this phenomenon in herself, but wished to keep it secret
from others.</p>

<p>Seeing she was displeased, I said no more, and half
persuaded myself that I had been deluded by my
senses. She had been living with us for some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
previous to the first appearance of the spectre, but after
this first visit the apparition repeatedly presented itself,
often as many as five or six times in the same day,
though sometimes disappearing for a week or a month,
and then returning. I observed that the figure always
appeared clearer and more defined the more my friend
appeared absorbed in some favourite occupation, or when
in a deep reverie. In whatsoever way she happened
to be occupied, whether in reading, writing, reckoning,
or in earnest conversation, the spectre would instantly
appear behind her, imitating her every movement with
the precision of a looking-glass.</p>

<p>Of course, this peculiarity in her constitution caused
no slight terror to myself, as well as to my father, who
was then alive, and some intimate friends; yet after a
time, finding that the visits of the apparition boded no
harm, and getting accustomed to the same, we hailed
our spiritual visitant as a welcome guest, cracking jokes
in its presence, and even addressing it with so little
appearance of reverence, that had it not been a very
good-tempered spectre, it must have resented our rudeness.
But the double never showed any resentment,
unless treating us all with silent contempt may be considered
as resentment. Indeed, it had never been once
known to utter a sound; neither did it appear to be
conscious of our presence.</p>

<p>I remember on one occasion, for a frolic, throwing
a heavy book at its head, but this had no further effect
than to disturb for a moment the luminous ether of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
which the spectre appeared composed, and which
speedily re-settled itself, while the phantom seemed
unconscious of having received injury or insult of any
kind. The book passed through its head as if it had
been air or smoke, and fell to the ground. I was bold
enough once to walk up to it and take it by the arm,
and found to my surprise, that there was a slight resistance,
like that of muslin or crape, but it melted
within my grasp, and I noticed that wherever I placed
my hand, that that part of the figure was instantly
wanting, and did not right itself until I withdrew my
touch.</p>

<p>Sometimes the whole figure would disappear if I
came within two paces of it, and it was not always of
the same consistency, being sometimes less palpable
than at others. This I observed to be dependent upon
the greater or less absorption of my friend in her occupation
or reverie. It is also remarkable that the more
clearly defined and life-like the phantom appeared, the
more exhausted and haggard grew my friend, and <i>vice
versa</i>.</p>

<p>But I must now return to the second visit of our
spiritual companion.</p>

<p>You may well imagine my terror and consternation
at its first appearance, yet when the first shock had
passed over, I should probably never have related the
vision to a single soul, and set down everything to hallucination,
had I not shortly after caught a second glimpse of
the spectre. This time my friend and I happened to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
playing chess together, when, whilst waiting for her to
move, I distinctly saw the double leaning over her chair,
as if in the act of assisting her in the game.</p>

<p>"Look, Claribel," I cried; "there it is again, you
can't deny it this time," whereupon the figure instantly
disappeared.</p>

<p>Now, as my friend still persisted that it was nothing
more than my delusion, I began to be alarmed for my
own health, and acquainted my father with what I had
seen. He, too, laughed at me, and called it a silly
girlish fancy, but said no more until I had seen it again
three or four times, going immediately to my father
each time after the vision had presented itself, and
describing to him exactly the attitude and the gestures
of the apparition on each successive visit.</p>

<p>Then my father became alarmed for the state of my
health, and a doctor was sent for, that I might be bled.
But on the doctor's arrival, he could detect nothing
wrong with me; but just to satisfy my father, ordered
me a little harmless physic, and took his departure.
Believing that whether the doctor perceived it or not,
that I must really be in a very bad state, I took all his
medicine in regular doses, and at the times prescribed,
carrying out his injunctions to the letter.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the vision continued, appearing several
times a day, and remaining sometimes almost half the
day at a visit. Upon hearing all this, my father called
for the doctor again, and positively insisted on my being
bled this time. I remember that I was averse to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
operation, never having undergone it before, and imagining
that the pain would be much greater than I found
it in reality. I therefore begged&mdash;finding my father so
determined&mdash;that my friend might be present during
the operation to give me courage.</p>

<p>This was assented to, and my friend was called into
the parlour, looking pale and trembling, as if she fancied
herself guilty of the pain about to be inflicted on me.
She remained stationary in front of me, with a look of
sweet commiseration in her face, but without uttering
a word.</p>

<p>Once or twice I thought she was going to speak, but
she checked herself, and then I noticed a struggle going
on within her, as if she would have said, "Ought I not
to prevent this operation, and openly confess that what
my friend has seen, is not an hallucination, but a reality;
a phenomenon belonging to my constitution? But,
no; I dare not."</p>

<p>This was how I read the expression of her face.
However, the operation passed over with far less pain
than I had expected, when, oh, wonderful! on looking
up again at the face of my friend, who was standing
motionless as a statue, I perceived once more her
double, not this time as usual, standing behind her
and imitating her attitude, but pacing up and down the
room with rapid steps and wringing her hands, as if in
despair.</p>

<p>Feeling somewhat weak from loss of blood, I forbore
to cry out, but my wild looks attracted the attention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
my father and the doctor to the spot my eyes were fixed
upon, when, following the direction of my eyes, both
suddenly started in extreme terror, such as I have
never seen expressed before or since upon the faces of
any two of the stronger sex.</p>

<p>The doctor halted in tying on the bandage, and
trembled like an aspen, while my father staggered and
fell against the wall. For some minutes not a word
was spoken, when my friend probably guessing the cause
of our alarm, suddenly turned her head in the direction
of their gaze, when the apparition instantly vanished.
Each looked at the other, and the doctor declared that
such a case had never before occurred in all his
experience, nor would he have believed it had he had
other testimony than that of his own eyes.</p>

<p>My friend then, her eyes filled with tears, begged of
us all present to keep the matter a secret, and not to
publish it throughout the village. Upon being questioned
concerning the phenomenon, it appeared that what we
had all seen was a reality, having as she alleged been
seen by others before. She said that she was not
conscious of its presence, save by the looks of consternation
she saw depicted on the faces of others; that
she had no control over the apparition, as it would
appear and disappear without her knowledge, and that
she had never seen it herself but once&mdash;in the looking-glass&mdash;when
it caused her such a preternatural horror
that she never afterwards used a looking-glass without
a shudder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>This phenomenon in her nature, moreover, made
her very unhappy, as on this account people used to
shun her, considering the apparition as the work of the
Evil One, and deeming her guilty of some fearful crime,
for such a judgment ever to be permitted to persecute
her.</p>

<p>The doctor and my father, their first surprise once
over, attempted to console her, assuring her that they
neither of them conceived her capable of anything like
a crime, recommending her to keep quiet and not to
worry herself on that account.</p>

<p>The doctor, to console her, further promised to keep
her secret; but, in spite of his earnest assurances that
he would not breathe a word of it to mortal man, a
pamphlet appeared shortly afterwards in the doctor's
own name, announcing a new form of contagious
nervous disease, in which the visual organs of a healthy
individual might become so affected by contact with a
person suffering from hallucinations as to cause him to
see or fancy he sees the object reflected on the retina of
the patient by his diseased imagination. An instance
of this was given as having occurred in the village, and
though the names of the parties concerned were not
given in full, the neighbours had no doubt as to whom
was meant by C&mdash;&mdash; F&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>The pamphlet made some stir at the time, and poor
Claribel, my bashful and retiring friend, found herself
made the lion of the season, and pestered past all
endurance by anxious inquiries and impertinent visits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
from strangers, who came from far, hoping to have their
curiosity gratified by a re-appearance of the spectre. If
such was their object in calling, and it undoubtedly was,
they one and all of them went away terribly disappointed,
for not in one single case did the apparition vouchsafe
to manifest itself.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these continued visits from strangers to
one so shy and retired as my friend, made her excessively
nervous, and were beginning to undermine her health,
which, the doctor perceiving, he gave instant orders
that she should receive no visits but those of her most
intimate friends.</p>

<p>Visitors still continued to call for some little time
afterwards, but were refused admittance on the plea of
my friend's delicate health, and their visits grew fewer
and farther between, till at length they ceased altogether,
and Claribel's health began to improve.</p>

<p>As everything has an end, even the gossip of a little
village, so in time people grew tired, both of hearing or
retailing what they had heard and retailed so often
before, till at length nobody believed a word about the
apparition; and because they could not explain the
cause of the phenomenon, hushed their minds to sleep
by calling it imposture, delusion, ignorant credulity, and
the like.</p>

<p>The ghost had never appeared to them or to those
who had taken so much trouble as to come from afar
on purpose to see it, and the deduction was that as
the spirit had refused to manifest itself to such respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
people as these, it was not likely that it had ever
vouchsafed to make its appearance to anyone, so the
affair was settled.</p>

<p>Time rolled on, and both my friend and I were
promoted from pupils to teachers in our school. The
gossip of the village had long ceased; in fact, Claribel's
spiritual tormentor had discontinued its visits now for so
long that she began to hope that they had ceased for
ever.</p>

<p>Claribel was now fast ripening into womanhood,
and found herself no longer shunned and whispered
about as a person guilty of some horrible crime which
had called down the just vengeance of Heaven upon
her, but passed by like any other, without allusion to
the past; nay, more, she began to be courted by people
in general, being known as a young woman of most
excellent character. Being of an extremely prepossessing
appearance, it was natural that she should be made a
mark for all the young men of the village to discharge
their amorous glances at, and she soon found herself
surrounded by a crowd of swains who talked soft
nonsense to her, and who would fain make her believe
that they were dying with love for her.</p>

<p>Claribel, however, turned a deaf ear to them all.
She was not a girl to be wooed by soft nonsense;
indeed, you would have said she was a girl not likely to
marry at all, she was so retired and showed such
indifference to the conversation of young men, and took
no pains whatever to set herself off to advantage in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
eyes. Nevertheless this did not deter admirers from
flocking around her. In fact, I rather think her coldness
and apparent negligence of dress and general personal
appearance rather incited them the more. I have
called her indifferent to personal appearance; not that
she was not scrupulously clean and neat; no one could
be more so. But there she was content to remain.</p>

<p>She cared not to deck herself out with bows and
ribbons, by the wearing of trumpery jewellery, or by any
exaggerated fashion of wearing her hair. It is just this
simplicity in woman which attracts most men, and it is
natural enough that it should do so, as it argues a certain
forgetfulness of self, a modest and unselfish nature,
which is the basis of every womanly virtue, and therefore
to be sought after in a wife. Foolish women imagine
that men are to be caught by being run after. They
therefore spare no expense in their toilet, study arts
and graces, and omit nothing which they think ought to
captivate the opposite sex; but as they too often over-step
the bounds of modesty, their flimsy designs are
seen through, and they find themselves laughed at by
those they had hoped to make their prey.</p>

<p>Claribel had known such women in her time, and
pitied rather than despised them, for there was nothing
harsh in her nature. She was often quizzed in her turn
by many a jimp-waisted hoyden for being a dowdy,
but she would pass by their remarks with a good-humoured
smile, and say little, for she was of few
words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Our school was now well filled with pupils, who,
one and all, grew most attached to my young friend&mdash;to
both of us in fact&mdash;but I rather think that she was the
favourite.</p>

<p>There was not a person in or out of the school
that could say a word against Claribel Falkland;
there was something so inoffensive, so modest, and, at
the same time, winning about her; such consideration
for others, such a looking out of herself, if I may so
term it. Then she had the knack of teaching&mdash;a rare
gift&mdash;and was as mild and patient as a lamb, thus
endearing all hearts towards her.</p>

<p>One day when giving a lesson in geography to her
class (this was about a year after the last apparition of
the spectre) I, who was giving a lesson in arithmetic to
some younger children in the opposite corner of the
schoolroom, was suddenly startled by a scream of
surprise from the girls of my friend's class.</p>

<p>"Look! look! oh, just look, Miss Sykes," they
cried in terror, "look, <i>there are two Miss Falklands</i>!"</p>

<p>I raised my eyes at the cry, and saw to my dismay,
my friend's old tormentor&mdash;the double&mdash;behind her, as
usual, and imitating her action, my friend being at that
moment in the act of pointing to a map. I walked
across the room to my friend, hoping to drive away the
spectre in so doing, but it remained some minutes
longer before it entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>I caught the eye of my friend, who looked mournfully
at me, and added in a low tone of voice, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
passed her, "Is it not provoking? Could anything be
more annoying?"</p>

<p>I did not tell the schoolgirls that I myself saw the
figure, and tried to laugh them out of a "silly fancy,"
as I called it, fearing that I might be called upon as a
witness, should this report reach the ears of the school-mistress,
and it might prejudice folks against my friend
as a teacher, so I affected harshness, and said I begged
I should hear no more of such stuff, and the affair
dropped for the time; but now that the double had
recommenced its visits, it came frequently, and always
in class time, to my friend's great discomfiture.</p>

<p>Of course, there was no getting out of it now. The
school-mistress was called, and saw the same thing; and
I myself was obliged to see it with the rest. The
school-mistress was very much bewildered, as well she
might be. She declared she did not know what to
make of it. She could hardly bring herself to think
that it was a messenger of good, and Miss Falkland's
character was so unimpeachable that she could still less
believe that anything bad should be permitted to
torment her. In fact, she did not know what to think,
so she called for the rector of the parish, that he might
speak with the apparition; and if it should prove an evil
one, to exorcise it.</p>

<p>The rector came, but being disappointed in seeing
the spectre, came a second, third, and fourth time, with
the like success, till at length he went away in a huff,
and begged they would trouble him no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>One Sunday, however, as the rector was in the
middle of his sermon, his eyes being fixed on our
school, we noticed him suddenly turn pale and tremble.
He was unable to go on with his sermon. I followed
his eyes, and found, as I half expected, my friend and
her double seated close together. The girls shrieked
and started, and a commotion was being made in the
church; so much so, that Claribel was obliged to get up
and walk out, her double following close at her heels.</p>

<p>Fancy poor Claribel, who was like a nun in her love
of solitude and retirement, having to walk out of church
through a crowd of people all the way home again with
a duplicate of herself following in her footsteps!</p>

<p>You must not suppose that the matter stopped here.
The remarks of the rustics who met her on the way, the
village gossip that now broke out afresh&mdash;worse than
ever before&mdash;the suspicious looks she received on all
sides, all contributed to mortify her; but what appeared
to completely break her spirit was the sudden falling off
of one half of her pupils. Of course, she could make
no doubt as to the cause of this. Even the rest of the
pupils, she thought, grew colder to her, and they, too,
dropped off one by one, until the poor girl had not a
single pupil left.</p>

<p>When matters arrived at this point it was hinted to
her by the school-mistress that on account of the great
damage this unfortunate peculiarity of hers had done
the school, that it was better for her on the whole,
to leave. The school-mistress added that she was aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
that it was no fault of my young friend's, and it was with
much regret that she was obliged to part with her; yet
what could she do? She could not afford to lose all
her pupils; and thus it was my poor friend lost a
situation upon which she depended to begin her little
savings. Much and bitterly did she weep over her
cursed existence, and earnestly prayed that she might
be liberated from her tormentor.</p>

<p>Since she had left her position as a school teacher
she had led a life of such rigid retirement that it was
with the greatest difficulty she could be persuaded to
leave the house, even in my company, to take the air
and exercise that her health required. She refused to
see anyone unless it was the rector, who would
occasionally call in the evening to take a dish of tea
with us.</p>

<p>It was on one of these visits, when we were seated
round the fire, conversing agreeably&mdash;the rector was
relating some amusing anecdote, to which we were all
listening attentively, the rector himself laughing at his
own story&mdash;when suddenly we noticed that he stopped
short in the middle of his laughing, turned pale, and
rose from his chair.</p>

<p>The cause of this sudden change immediately
became apparent to us all. There, immediately behind
the chair of Claribel, who had been listening attentively
to the rector, with her chin resting on her hand, was
her double in exactly the same position, with its eyes
fixed intently on the rector's face. The rector having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
started to his feet, assumed a tone and manner which he
in vain strove to render firm, and conjured the figure
in the name of the Holy Trinity, if it were a thing of
evil, to come out of her and trouble her no more; but
his exorcism fell as upon the wind, the spectre apparently
not hearing his words, and departing at its leisure some
two or three minutes afterwards, appearing again once
or twice in the same evening during the rector's visit.</p>

<p>The following Sunday prayers were read publicly in
the church, with the view of dispelling the evil spirit, as
it was called, and mention of the phenomenon was
made in the rector's sermon, but all to no purpose.
The spectre would appear and disappear whenever it
chose, its coming being never heralded by any particular
signs, and its vanishing just as uncertain.</p>

<p>If anyone particularly wished it to appear, it was as
if the spectre took a malicious delight in disappointing
them; if, on the other hand, its presence was exceedingly
undesirable, it would be almost certain to appear.</p>

<p>Of the numerous admirers of Claribel it will be
necessary for me only to mention two. The first was
one John Archer, an ardent and virtuous youth, aged
twenty-one, whose honest English face revealed the
sincerity of his heart. He held the post of gamekeeper
on the estate of Lord Edgedown. He was bold and
generous, but of a nature so bashful and timid in matters
regarding our sex, that he would have allowed himself
to be cut out in a love affair by a man not possessing
one half his merit or his good looks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>As my father was on good terms with the father of
John Archer, John was always a welcome visitor at our
house, and thus began his acquaintance with Claribel.
I really think if he had persisted in his suit, as a more
courageous lover would have done, that he must at last
have won the love of Claribel. I know that Claribel
had the highest esteem for him, and had learnt to
sympathise with him as one noble nature sympathises
with another.</p>

<p>They grew to treat each other as brother and sister,
but this was all. The other lover was a totally different
sort of man. Richard de Chevron was a scion of a
noble house, had received the education of a gentleman,
and could mix in the highest society; but he was
debauched, profligate, a gamester, and a drunkard, of a
mean and spiteful disposition, with nothing noble
whatever in his character and not even good looking,
but he had that persistency in wooing which John
lacked, added to a very smooth tongue and plentiful
flow of language. Neither was he quite without accomplishments;
he could both play and sing well, and
dance to perfection; qualities which might have won
the heart of a less austere maiden than my friend
Claribel. But Claribel retired, as she was, in disposition
and a perfect dunce in that education which mixing in
the world gives, had yet by nature, by way of compensation,
such a marvellously acute perception of human
character, that it bordered on the prophetic in many
instances. In a word, she was a physiognomist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>On seeing Richard de Chevron for the first time, she
had taken an instant aversion to him, without ever
having heard anything against his character, and though
De Chevron tried hard to dispel the sinister impression
with which he could not fail to observe he had inspired
her&mdash;and I must own that he did his best&mdash;yet
that impression never left her, but, on the contrary,
deepened after every visit.</p>

<p>Now, Richard de Chevron was nephew to Lord
Edgedown, and heir-apparent to that earl's fortune and
estates; at least, he often used to hint as much, but this
was evidently more brag, as he was a younger son, and
was known to be no particular favourite with his uncle
on account of his dissipated habits. He had also the
hopes of coming in for another fortune, so he said; that
of Squire Broadacre, a relative on his mother's side,
whose estate joined that of Lord Edgedown's; but
whether all this were true or not, it made not the
slightest difference to Claribel in her estimation of the
man. She still saw in him a low, debauched, false, and
perjured villain, seeking to hide under a mask of studied
courtesy the evil promptings of his reptile heart.</p>

<p>Even had De Chevron succeeded in making
Claribel marry him, such a match could have brought
nothing but misery to her, even from a pecuniary point
of view, for at the time we knew him he had not a
penny of his own, and was, besides, head over ears
in debt.</p>

<p>Men of the De Chevron class do not often mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
marriage when they go a-courting, unless it happens to
be particularly to their interest. What they want is a
fortune, and not a wife. If the former can be had
without the latter, why so much the better; if not, they
are content to put up with the latter incumbrance for
the sake of being able to pay off their debts.</p>

<p>Now, poor Claribel was an orphan, without a penny
in the world. What good could his attentions bode
the poor child? Claribel, however, was not mercenary,
and had she been capable of loving any man, she would
have been contented to live on a crust, and to have
worked hard for it; but she appeared not to be destined
for earthly affection. The nearest approach she ever
made towards that passion commonly called love was
the deep friendship she had entertained for the youthful
gamekeeper.</p>

<p>Now, to meet with a rival in the person of his uncle's
gamekeeper was gall and wormwood to Richard de
Chevron. He knew that John Archer was a young
man of trust who received a good salary, and was of a
rank nearer to that of Claribel's than his own was, and
his attentions would be more readily looked upon as
earnest.</p>

<p>Besides, John was good looking and noble, and
had it not been for his excessive modesty in coming
forward, would have been the very man of all men most
likely to ensure the love of such a girl as Claribel. The
intentions of De Chevron were not honourable, whatever
his protestations might have made them out. He could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
not afford to marry Claribel, nor did he ever for a
moment meditate such a thing.</p>

<p>Had an intimate friend asked him in confidence if
he really entertained thoughts of marriage towards the
girl he so ardently professed to love, he would have
burst out laughing in his face, and asked him if he took
him for a fool. No; he simply desired to win the heart
of Claribel, and succeeding in that, he looked upon his
prey as certain. But as yet he had not succeeded; nay,
more, he had a favoured rival&mdash;a young man of good
natural advantages, and in every way qualified to make
Claribel happy, even though he were only his uncle's
gamekeeper and had not received a gentleman's
education. He thought of the difference of Claribel's
treatment of this young boor and that of himself&mdash;he,
the scion of a noble house!</p>

<p>Then jealously began to gnaw his heart, and he
found it to his interest that John Archer should be
removed for ever from his path. Being perfectly
unscrupulous and selfish, he cared not what means he
employed to execute his design, as long as no suspicion
should be attached to himself.</p>

<p>He could have waylaid and murdered his rival, if
he chose; have introduced poison in his cup, or bribed
an assassin to murder him, but none of these modes
suited De Chevron. The law was vigilant, inquiries
would be made, and the murder probably traced to his
own door. His reputation would suffer, to say nothing
of his own life being endangered. He would have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
accomplices, as he knew that no man was to be depended
upon; he would trust to no one but himself and his own
resources.</p>

<p>Like a wily Jesuit, he would work in the dark,
would be the cause of all the mischief that his own
atrocious brain could dictate, but himself remain hid.
Now, when Richard de Chevron first met John Archer
at my father's house, he treated him with coldness, not
to say haughtiness. He now completely changed his
tactics. He saw that the least show of contempt or
dislike towards the young gamekeeper, who was a general
favourite&mdash;and especially with Claribel&mdash;would be construed
into jealously on his part; and though this was
really the case, it did not suit him that everyone should
know it; therefore he entirely altered his conduct towards
his rival, and nothing now could be more kind and
courteous, more apparently generous than his treatment
of his uncle's gamekeeper.</p>

<p>He apologised if by any former brusqueness of
manner he had offended him, pleading that he had not
had the opportunity hitherto of studying his estimable
character, but that after long observation he had learnt
to appreciate his noble qualities, and should henceforth
entertain for him the highest esteem and friendship.
He would pat him playfully on the shoulder, call him
his friend, would make him every now and then some
trifling present, and even put in a good word for him to
my friend Claribel.</p>

<p>All this had the appearance of generosity, as De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Chevron designed it should have, and thus avert
suspicion from himself. We were all of us at home
much surprised and pleased at this extraordinary change,
especially as he had ceased for a time to persecute
Claribel with his attentions.</p>

<p>Richard de Chevron appeared to be turning over a
new leaf. When I say we were all deceived in De
Chevron's behaviour, I must not omit to state that there
was one exception, and that was Claribel herself, who
from the first had behaved with a freezing coldness
towards De Chevron, and, little as she knew of the world
and its wickedness, had such an instinctive distrust of
this man, that when he began to speak favourably to her
of John Archer, she trembled violently, and looked into
his face with such a searching glance that it seemed to
peer into the inmost recesses of his soul.</p>

<p>De Chevron cowered beneath her gaze; he felt
himself distrusted, and was probably little flattered at
the opinion of himself he saw written in her eyes.
Nevertheless, he would not have shown for the world
that he was disconcerted; he was a practised dissembler,
and instead of being abashed, grew more witty and
talkative than ever, more and more friendly to his rival,
only I noticed that he avoided the eyes of Claribel as
much as possible.</p>

<p>The fact was, he feared her; he, the artful, experienced
man of the world, crouched like an abject slave
before a simple village maiden. His guilty soul could
not brook the chaste glance of innocence. He knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
himself to be a false degraded wretch, and quailed
before her moral superiority.</p>

<p>However, Richard de Chevron had worked himself
into favour with all of us; in fact, we grew delighted
with him, still excepting Claribel, who seemed very
unreasonably prejudiced against him, as we all thought.
She would declare to me in private that from the very
first the aspect of De Chevron had been repulsive to
her; but of late, so far from having overcome her
impression, he had grown perfectly intolerable in her
eyes; nay, that she was seized with such horror and
loathing when he was in the room as she could not find
words to express.</p>

<p>She had a presentiment of evil, and it seemed to her,
moreover, as if he were using some occult power over
her that she, however, was determined to resist.</p>

<p>I tried to laugh her out of these fancies as being
quite unfounded, and attributed them to her nerves being
over-wrought from want of sufficient air and exercise;
but all without avail; she remained as confirmed as
ever in her prejudices. It is now some time since I
made allusion to Claribel's spiritual visitant. She had
long been undisturbed by its visits; indeed, ever since
De Chevron and John had commenced calling at the
house, and even before. It is uncertain whether either
of them had ever heard of the phenomenon. I rather
think not, as De Chevron, who mixed almost entirely
in the upper circles, would not easily have come in the
way of our village cackle, especially as he was often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
absent from the village for months at a time; and as
for John, being constantly engaged on Lord Edgedown's
estate, he knew comparatively little of the world without.
But whether they did or not, it is certain that the
subject was never broached during all that time.</p>

<p>We have mentioned before that Claribel's spiritual
visitor was fitful and capricious in its visits. It
might appear at any moment; but then we had been
free from its company for so long, that we had dared to
hope that it had forgotten all about us and would never
return, until one morning new fears arose in my mind
from a little circumstance which I shall now relate
to you.</p>

<p>Observing that my young friend rose from her couch
looking poorly, I inquired into the cause of her jaded
looks.</p>

<p>"Oh, Molly," she replied, "I've had such a dreadful
dream about poor John. I am sure that some danger
threatens him."</p>

<p>"What danger do you imagine threatens him,
Claribel?" said I. "Tell me your dream."</p>

<p>"I really do not know if I can," she replied; "it was
so very confused. I thought that John Archer stood in
danger of his life at the hands of Richard de Chevron,
and yet it was not Richard de Chevron, but another;
then, again, it was. I remember something about a
murdered man, and fearing it was John Archer, but
on examining the corpse it was another. Then I
remember seeing John Archer handcuffed, and in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
agony of mind, and I thought him guilty of the murder,
and then he was not guilty. Then the dream began to
change in such a manner as it would be impossible to
relate it; but throughout I remember the fiendish
face of Richard de Chevron. I was seized with an
inexpressible horror, and could bear it no longer; then
I awoke."</p>

<p>"My dear Claribel," said I, "pray do not disturb
yourself for such a ridiculous dream. You ought to
know that all dreams are mad, the offspring of impaired
digestion or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she impatiently cut me short by a wave of the
hand, as if she were determined to believe in the warning
character of her dream, despite all my sophistry.</p>

<p>However, I attempted a second time to account for
the dream by the aversion she had taken to Richard de
Chevron at first sight and her constantly brooding over
her unfounded impressions. I tried argument, I tried
ridicule; but finding her proof against either, I held my
tongue and took up a piece of work.</p>

<p>Claribel had thrown herself into an arm-chair, and
there sat listlessly, without occupying herself or hardly
exchanging a word with me. Once, indeed, she gasped
out to herself "Oh, that I could save him!" and then
relapsed into her usual silence.</p>

<p>About five minutes after, chancing to look up, I
observed that my friend appeared to be more languid
than ever. She was dreadfully pale, her lips colourless
and slightly parted, the eyes half-closed. I thought she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
was in a swoon, and now somewhat alarmed, I rose and
advanced towards her.</p>

<p>"Claribel," I cried, "what ails you&mdash;are you
unwell?"</p>

<p>She waved me away with her hand, so imagining it
was nothing more than a little weakness, I withdrew
myself and resumed my work. Soon afterwards she
appeared to rally, and sat up in her chair. Her colour
had returned somewhat, and her eye seemed brighter,
but her voice was still weak as she muttered, "I have
seen him. Oh! why did you disturb me?"</p>

<p>"Seen him!" I exclaimed. "Seen whom?"</p>

<p>"John Archer," she replied.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said I; "you have been dreaming."</p>

<p>"I tell you, Molly," she replied, rather pettishly, "I
have seen him, and would have warned him had you
not disturbed me."</p>

<p>"Silly child," said I; "you have been dreaming;
but you looked so very ill that I grew alarmed, for I
thought you were in a swoon."</p>

<p>Just then my father entered the room and commenced
talking on household matters, so our conversation
dropped; nor did I give it a further thought until the
evening, when John Archer made his appearance, as he
frequently did, to take his tea with us.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mistress Claribel," said he. "You
were in a mighty hurry to quit my company this
morning after paying me such an unexpected visit. Methinks
you are chary of your presence. It is a mystery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
to me how you appeared and disappeared from me
without my perceiving either the coming or the going
of you."</p>

<p>"How say you, Master John?" said my father,
pricking up his ears. "Do you say that our Claribel
paid you a visit this morning?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sir," replied John; "at about nine o'clock this
morning, as I was walking along with my gun, on his
lordship's estate, I suddenly saw Mistress Claribel
coming straight in front of me. She looked as if she
were about to speak to me, when all of a sudden&mdash;I'm
sure I can't tell how&mdash;she disappeared. I looked round
about me, and called her, but there was no one.</p>

<p>"Then I began to be alarmed, thinking something
must have happened to Mistress Claribel, and that I
had seen her ghost. I could not let the day pass by
without dropping in to call to see if she were all right."</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken, John," said I. "I assure
you that Claribel has not left the house all day. She
has felt rather unwell."</p>

<p>"Not left the house!" exclaimed Archer. "Why I
saw her quite plain this morning."</p>

<p>"You must have been dreaming," said my father.</p>

<p>But I noticed that he gave a glance of peculiar
meaning at my friend and self. I knew what was
passing in his mind. I, too, shared the same apprehensions.
John Archer must have re-encountered
Claribel's second self, her much dreaded double. I
then recalled the words of Claribel that morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>I have seen him. Oh, why did you disturb me?</i>"</p>

<p>My poor friend, I observed, was dreadfully confused
as my father's eye rested on her. The colour mounted
to her cheeks, then vanished again, leaving her deadly
pale, and she seemed desirous to escape notice. Her
restlessness became extreme when John began persisting
that he had not been dreaming, that he could vouch for
what he had seen, etc., etc.</p>

<p>"You should get yourself bled, Master Archer,"
said my father; "you can't be well."</p>

<p>"I assure you I am in the very best of health,"
persisted John.</p>

<p>"And I assure you, Master Archer, that Claribel
has not quitted this house to-day, to my certain
knowledge," said my father.</p>

<p>"What, not for a moment?" went on Archer, most
annoyingly. "How say you, Mistress Claribel, was it
not you I saw this morning on Lord Edgedown's estate
as I was walking along with my gun over my shoulder?"</p>

<p>Claribel grew red and pale by turns, and her lips
began to move, as if she felt herself forced to give some
answer; but at that moment my father seemed troubled
with a violent fit of coughing which drowned her reply.
John waited quietly until the coughing was over, and
then began again.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say it was not you I saw this
morning?"</p>

<p>The coughing was resumed, and strange enough,
always returned just as John Archer began to open his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
mouth. John looked in wonderment, first at Claribel,
then at my father, then at Claribel again, and finally at
me. He had unwittingly touched upon a sore place.
This he seemed to be aware of; but how he had been
to blame was a mystery to him.</p>

<p>He suddenly changed the conversation, and began
discoursing on indifferent topics. The coughing ceased
for that evening. As he rose to go we followed him to
the door, and I observed that Claribel, who was the
foremost, whispered something secretly into his ear at
parting. I myself was immediately behind her, and
overheard the hurried words, "John, you have an
enemy. Beware!"</p>

<p>Then she put her finger quickly to her lips, to
prevent him giving any outward expression to his
wonderment, and the door closed upon our guest.</p>

<p>"You silly girl," said I to my friend as we were
undressing that evening, previous to retiring to rest.
"What nonsense of you to try and infect that young
man with your own ungrounded fears. Do you think I
did not overhear what you said?"</p>

<p>She looked a little downcast at this, but then
instantly recovering, by way of consoling herself, she
ejaculated, "Nevertheless, I have warned him," and
she clasped her hands above her head enthusiastically.</p>

<p>No further word was said about John Archer that
night. On the following morning I had occasion to
call upon a neighbour who lived some four or five
miles off. I rose early, and started off on foot. As I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
was returning home it came on to rain in such torrents
that I was forced to take shelter under a little shed that
was annexed to a small hut standing alone upon a hill,
far from any other human dwelling.</p>

<p>It was the only place at hand, and had it not been
for the excessive inclemency of the weather, I might
have thought twice before choosing such a place of
refuge, for this was the abode of Madge Mandrake as
she was called&mdash;a personage feared by all, far and
wide, both young and old. She was renowned in the
villages round about for her skill in telling fortunes, in
concocting drugs of every description, from love philtres
to the deadliest poisons, not less than for malice in
bringing to pass all sorts of trouble upon those who had
had the misfortune to offend her. If a cow died, it was
Madge's doing; if the milk turned sour, or the crops
were blighted, Madge was accused of it; if a person
died suddenly, or an accident happened to anyone,
Madge likewise had the credit of it. Her dwelling,
therefore, was shunned by all, and when she ventured
to walk abroad and to mix in crowded thoroughfares,
she had but to lift her crutch to send the whole populace
flying helter-skelter, for fear of being enchanted into
unclean beasts, reptiles, and other loathsome things.</p>

<p>You may imagine then, gentlemen, my feelings;
though naturally courageous at finding myself obliged
to seek shelter near the house of so formidable a
personage, I did my utmost to make no stir, so as not
to betray my whereabouts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a small window that looked from the
cottage into the shed, but so begrimed with dirt that I
should not have been able to take a peep into the house,
had it not been for a pane of glass that was wanting.
Through this I was enabled to see the interior of this
unhallowed dwelling without being perceived. Before
I ventured to peep through it I heard two voices
conversing together.</p>

<p>I held my breath, and listened. The former was
the harsh, cracked voice of the crone herself; the latter
was evidently that of a man, and appeared to belong to a
person of culture, for the tones were soft and modulated.
I began to fancy I recognised them; nor was I mistaken,
as you shall hear soon.</p>

<p>"Well, Master de Chevron, and how have you
been progressing in your work since I saw you last?"
said the crone.</p>

<p>"Satisfactorily enough for my purpose, my good
Madge," replied the other voice. "I have brought it
with me for your approval."</p>

<p>Here the speaker, whom I could now recognise as
no other than Richard de Chevron, drew from under
his cloak something carefully wrapt up in tissue
paper. Having unwound the paper, he discovered a
small statue of a man, about a foot in height,
apparently in wax.</p>

<p>"Why, you have got it as like as could be!"
exclaimed the crone. "Yes, that is John Archer, sure
enough; there is no mistaking him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>My curiosity began to be roused, and Claribel's
apprehensions for John's safety rushed across my mind.
Though I was not near to the figure, I could see plainly
that it was intended for a likeness of John Archer, and
that it carried a gun over one arm. The hag seized the
image in one hand with a sort of fiendish glee, and
commenced mumbling some inarticulate sounds.</p>

<p>I trembled from the crown of my head to the soles
of my feet, for I had heard of this way of working
mischief on one's enemies from afar, and I feared lest
some dreadful harm should happen to poor John, so I
offered up a hasty prayer for his safety.</p>

<p>"The charm is said," croaked the witch. "Now
let the work begin."</p>

<p>Here she set the image upright, and taking a long
sharp pin she seemed about to transfix the waxen image
with it; but I noticed that her hand trembled violently.
I still continued to pray fervently, whereupon the witch
was seized with such a fit of sneezing and wheezing
that she was unable to proceed in her work.</p>

<p>"Why, Madge," said De Chevron, "what is the
matter? How have you managed to catch such a cold
all of a sudden?"</p>

<p>"Odds blood! I know not," answered the beldam;
"it is as if I was in church."</p>

<p>At the word "church" the wheezing came on
again.</p>

<p>"Ah! I see," said De Chevron; "It is the wind
that is howling through that broken pane of glass,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and he pointed to the very pane through which I was
peeping.</p>

<p>I thought my last hour was come, for I was sure
to be discovered. However, I ducked down in a corner,
whilst De Chevron stopped up the missing pane with a
filthy rag without even catching a sight of me.</p>

<p>Rising again to my feet, I managed to open the
little window the least bit ajar, but just enough to see
and hear all. My fright was so great all this time that I
had unwittingly slacked a little in my prayer, and just at
that moment Madge made a desperate plunge with the
pin, which appeared aimed at the heart of the image;
but as I had now recommenced my prayers, alas, somewhat
too late, the pin missed its mark, but pierced the
barrel of the gun, which, together with the thumb of the
figure, fell upon the table.</p>

<p>"Better next time, Madge," said De Chevron.
"Try again."</p>

<p>She made another essay, and then another, but
missed the figure altogether.</p>

<p>"I am not as young as I was," she said, by way of
apology, "and neither my eyesight nor my hand are to
be relied upon as of old."</p>

<p>However, she aimed again and again at the figure,
but with the same result.</p>

<p>"Why, you <i>are</i> getting old, Madge!" said De
Chevron, surprised at her repeated failures. "Come,
let me put the pins in."</p>

<p>Seizing the image with one hand and a long pin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
with the other&mdash;(here again my breath failed me through
fear, and I omitted to pray)&mdash;he first pierced the arm
of the figure that supported the gun in one place, and
then in another higher up. He then took a third pin
and seemed about to pierce the image in the region of
the heart, when I, now really alarmed for the victim,
again offered up a short and fervent prayer.</p>

<p>De Chevron instantly dropped the pin, as if it had
been red hot; but immediately taking up another, he
made a furious thrust at the body of the image, but his
hand went off widely from the mark, leaving the image
unscathed.</p>

<p>"Why, how is this?" exclaimed De Chevron, in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! Master de Chevron," laughed the witch,
"you are no better than old Madge after all."</p>

<p>"Well, this <i>is</i> strange!" muttered De Chevron to
himself, after having tried once or twice more and
failed.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure you have repeated the charm
aright, Madge?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure," replied the crone; "but, beshrew me,
if I don't think there is some hostile element at hand
that counteracts the charm. Just look at the way
Grimalkin arches his back and ruffles his fur."</p>

<p>I now noticed a huge black tom cat, of a size that
I never remember to have seen before or since, whose
luminous eyes flashed red and green by turns from an
obscure corner of the hovel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"There! there! <i>there</i>!" cried De Chevron, furiously,
accompanying each word with a thrust, but missing
each time.</p>

<p>Then, in his rage at being foiled thus, he raised the
image in order to dash it to the ground; but the wax
having melted somewhat in his hand, it stuck to his
fingers like pitch, and he was obliged to disengage it
gently and place it on the small table just underneath
the window through which I was peeping.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, Madge," said he, "there is
more witchcraft in this countercharm, whatever it is,
than in all your skill. There must be, as you say, some
contrary influence at work. How else should it be
possible for me to fail every time, as if I were smitten
with the palsy? Let us go out and see if anyone is
lurking near the hut."</p>

<p>So leaving the image on the table, he strode towards
the opposite door, which he opened wide, followed by
the beldam.</p>

<p>Not a moment was to be lost. The instant their
backs were turned I cautiously opened the window, and
introducing my arm until it touched the table beneath,
I secured the image, re-closed the window noiselessly,
and flew as fast as my feet could carry me through the
pelting rain with the image under my shawl.</p>

<p>I had hardly reached home, quite out of breath,
when Claribel came running to me, pale and trembling,
and wringing her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh! Molly, dear," she cried, sobbing, "what do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
you think has happened to that poor young man John
Archer?"</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked, anxiously. "Anything in
connection with Richard de Chevron?"</p>

<p>"I cannot exactly say that," she replied. "It seems
to have been purely an accident. This is how it was.
His gun suddenly burst in a most unaccountable manner
whilst he was carrying it over his arm, and carried off
one of his thumbs. No surgeon could be procured at
the time, and the wound appears to have gangrened and
to have infected the whole arm. The surgeon, who has
only just arrived, says that it will be necessary to
remove the arm to save his life."</p>

<p>"Not for worlds!" cried I, with animation. "I'll be
responsible for his life. There," said I, producing the
waxen image and hastily withdrawing the two pins still
sticking in the arm of the figure, and which in my hurry
I had omitted to extract till now. "There, now the
mortification in the arm will have stopped. Send
directly to the surgeon that the operation will be no
longer necessary. Nay, I will go myself."</p>

<p>"What does all this mean?" asked Claribel,
astonished beyond measure.</p>

<p>"No matter now," I answered. "I am off at once.
If you like you may come with me; but first let me
lock up this image in a place where it will not be
touched."</p>

<p>So saying, I put on my bonnet and shawl again, and
dragging Claribel after me, we ran with all our might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
and main to the cottage where poor John lay stretched
on a pallet, the surgeon with his knife ready sharpened
for the operation, standing over him, about to commence.
Another second would have been too late.</p>

<p>"Hold your hand, doctor!" I cried, suddenly.
"The mortification has ceased, and the operation will
be no longer necessary. I will be answerable for this
young man's life without his losing his arm."</p>

<p>I spoke with an authority that completely astonished
the doctor, for he looked bewilderingly first at me and
then at my friend; but at length said, "I understand
nothing of all this. I have been called here by this
young man's family to give my professional opinion, and
I say that unless he submits to lose his arm, his life will
be endangered."</p>

<p>"But the mortification has ceased. Would you
amputate a limb without necessity for so doing?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"Well, then, look for yourself. Where is the
mortification?"</p>

<p>Here the surgeon glanced at the arm, and looked
wondrous wise.</p>

<p>"The mortification has ceased beyond a doubt," he
said at length. "Well, I never saw such a thing in all
my life. What! am I dreaming," he muttered. "I do
not understand all this. How came you, Miss Molly,
to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said I.</p>

<p>Then lowering my mouth to his ear, I whispered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
few words, and put my finger to my lip, to enjoin
silence. The doctor arched his eyebrows till they
nearly touched the roots of his hair, screwed up his
mouth to the size of a buttonhole, and gave vent to a
prolonged "wh-e-w!"</p>

<p>He soon after left the house, and we were left alone
for a while to comfort the sufferer. During the few
moments that we were left alone together I recounted
briefly the whole of my adventure.</p>

<p>Both John and Claribel were completely thunder-struck
at my recital, and Claribel muttered half to herself
and half to me, "And to think that it should be
Richard de Chevron, after all. I knew he was a
villain."</p>

<p>John speedily recovered. He had received no
further injury than the loss of his thumb. He often
called at our house afterwards, and upon seeing the
waxen image immediately recognised it as a likeness of
himself. It being now beyond a doubt that Richard
de Chevron, out of jealousy, had conspired against the
life of John Archer and being equally certain in my own
mind, from a knowledge of De Chevron's character, that
he would not let his victim slip so easily through his
fingers, but, foiled in his first attempt, would lose no
time in employing some other means of removing his
rival from his path, I began to rack my brains in
search of some scheme to thwart the machinations of
this villain.</p>

<p>"What if he should make another waxed image, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
shutting himself up in his own house, carry out his
infernal spells without interruption?" I said to myself.
If so, what could I do?</p>

<p>John Archer should have our constant prayers;
beyond this there was no impediment to De Chevron's
evil designs. The law would give us no redress. I was
very sure of that. Witchcraft had ceased to be believed
in, and the case would be dismissed. One thought,
indeed, crossed my mind for a moment, which I
mentioned to Claribel, and this was to pay back De
Chevron in his own coin by converting the image
of John Archer into a likeness of De Chevron
and experimenting upon the villain from afar
in the same manner as he had designed to practise
against John Archer.</p>

<p>It was but a momentary thought and a sinful, and
the proposal was rejected by Claribel instantly and with
horror.</p>

<p>"Should we," said she, "put ourselves on a level
with a murderous villain, using against him the same
unhallowed means that he himself had not hesitated to
use against his victim?"</p>

<p>But besides the light in which my friend had put my
proposition, there was another argument against the
scheme that perhaps had more weight with me. In
order to change the image from the likeness of John
Archer into a likeness of De Chevron it would be
necessary to destroy the image altogether first, and this,
for what I knew, might put John Archer's life in peril.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
This last argument decided me, and I resolved to guard
the image as jealously as possible, and to proceed against
De Chevron by natural means solely. An idea flashed
across me that there might be some countercharm
against evil spells if we could only find it out. Indeed,
I remembered to have heard that there was, and
musing thus within myself, I suddenly recollected to
have heard a couplet in my childhood that ran thus:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Vervain and Dill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep witches from their will."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These two herbs, then, were countercharms. I was
resolved to try the experiment, so procuring some of each
without more delay, I gave them into the possession of
John Archer, who promised me to wear them always
about him; and whether or no De Chevron ever made
any further attempt against the life of his rival by
means of magic I know not, but if he did he must
signally have failed, as for ever so long afterwards
Archer enjoyed the most perfect health and remained
free from any further accident.</p>

<p>Whether De Chevron suspected that John Archer
possessed some countercharm against which his evil
spells were vain, or if he again essayed his magic after
his first defeat, we know not, but certain it was that he
still cherished hatred against his rival, upon whom he
was determined to bring trouble, if not by necromancy,
at least by natural means.</p>

<p>For some time past he had not been near us. This
was evidently to ward off suspicion from himself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
check the village gossip. However, soon after the
disappearance of the image&mdash;whether or no he suspected
it was I who purloined it and wished to brave the
matter out&mdash;he called and informed us that he was
going to London on important business, and had come
to take leave of us for a time. There was nothing in
his manner that appeared the least constrained or
abashed. On the contrary, he seemed more lively and
witty than usual, asked kindly after all our family, and
even John Archer, whom he said he had not seen for a
long time, although he had heard of his misfortune, for
which he professed great sympathy, and hoped the poor
fellow would not take his loss too much to heart; adding
that it was lucky that they had managed to save his life
without amputating his arm.</p>

<p>Throughout all his discourse his manner had so
much of frankness and sincerity that I could hardly
bring myself to believe that he was the same villain
whose infernal plot against the innocent John Archer,
I had accidentally unravelled. I began to think that
somehow or other I must have been under a delusion,
until chancing to glance towards a glazed cupboard in
which the wax figure stood upright and was easily
discernable from where I stood, the whole of my recent
adventure came back to me forcibly. Yet there sat the
author of this unhallowed deed, this would-be murderer,
smiling and chatting and paying compliments with the
easy grace of a courtier, with a countenance frank and
open as a spring morning. How could a girl of my age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
ignorant of the world and its wickedness, possibly
imagine that a heart so black could be concealed underneath
so smooth an exterior? Had I not had positive
proof of his villainy within reach, I should certainly
never have believed him capable of such a deed.
Even as it was I was obliged to gaze frequently
at the cupboard in order to reassure myself that I was
not dreaming and to prevent myself from being won
over by his tongue.</p>

<p>De Chevron was a quick observer, and noticed our
furtive glances towards the cupboard. Then fixing his
spy-glass in his eye, he looked in the same direction;
but either saw or affected to see nothing. Afterwards
he got up and walked about the room, conversing the
while, and in so doing passed several times in front of
the cupboard, looking in casually as he passed.</p>

<p>I felt sure that he must have seen the image, though
there was nothing in his manner that I could discover
at all confused or unusual. I believe he would have
braved the matter out if I had told him to his face that
it was I myself who had stolen the image after I had
overheard with my own ears this villainous plot against
poor John. He was just the sort of man who would
have looked me full in the face and denied ever in his
life having been in Madge Mandrake's cottage.</p>

<p>He would have tried to make me believe that I had
been the victim of some fearful delusion from my over-excited
fears or what not, that the image was not of his
making; would have denied ever having set eyes on it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
before. Nor would, in all probability, have seen any
likeness whatever to John Archer, and would have
treated as nothing more than a coincidence the fact of
John's gun and the loss of his thumb occurring at the
same time that the gun and thumb of the waxen figure
were damaged by old Madge's pin thrust.</p>

<p>He would have asked me if I thought him capable of
believing in such trumpery, and would have tried to
laugh me out of my superstition. All this I should have
expected from him, such was his amount of assurance.
Once I had it on the tip of my tongue to ask him what
he thought of the image, and if he knew anyone it
resembled; and would have done it, too, as I was
anxious to observe what effect a sudden allusion to the
image would have had upon him, but at that moment
my father, who knew nothing of the affair of the waxen
image, entered the room, and the conversation took
another direction.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards he left the house, promising to
call again after his return from London. As he had
been so particular in telling us of his intended visit to
London, of course, I believed him. What reason could
I have had for not doing so? Nevertheless, it proved
to be all a falsehood. He never had any intention of
going to London at all; and never left the village.</p>

<p>But why this deceit? you will naturally ask. Listen,
and tell me if you could have imagined a scheme so
diabolical as the following ever entering into human
brain. To carry out his base designs he hired a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
pedlar, one Michael Rag, well known to be a shady
character, and envious of John Archer's comparatively
easy circumstances, so having talked him over, if not
by bribery, at least by instigating him in a manner
suggested by his own natural cunning as calculated to
excite the covetous disposition of the tool he intended
to use for his own purposes, to purloin John Archer's
silver watch, a present he had received from his master
for his faithful services.</p>

<p>This watch De Chevron represented to the pedlar as
being one of superior workmanship, and far too good for
a man of John Archer's position to wear. He blamed
his uncle for lavishing handsome presents upon undeserving
hangers-on. Who, after all, was John Archer?
He (De Chevron) could remember him in worse
circumstances even than the pedlar himself. Whence
his good fortune? From his merit? Pooh! It was
easy enough for any man to keep a good place when he
had once got it, if he wasn't quite a fool. Then as to
his getting it in the first place, mere luck. Why, as if
there were not many a better man than John Archer for
such a post. Was he more honest than any other?
Bah! every man is honest until he is found out to be
the contrary.</p>

<p>Thus, first by raising the pedlar's cupidity by a vivid
description of the watch, then by giving an additional
stimulant to his envious nature by representing the
owner of the watch as unworthy of such a present, he
finally wound up by insinuating, rather than broadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
stating, that the pedlar himself was a man of merit and
deserved being in a better position than John Archer, if
all men had their rights.</p>

<p>In fact, such was De Chevron's power of persuasion,
that he at last, by dint of subtle arguments, made
irresistible by the courteous grace by which they were
set off, and, moreover, making it appear that he himself
could have no object in giving such advice, that he at
length succeeded in making the pedlar believe that he
was a very ill-used man, and that as fortune had been so
niggardly to him, considering his merits, whilst she
squandered her favours on the undeserving, that it was
quite excusable in him; nay, it was his duty, and nothing
more than what he owed to himself to seek his own
fortune by appropriating a portion of that superfluous
wealth unjustly held back from him by the capricious
goddess and given into unworthy hands.</p>

<p>It was not difficult for De Chevron to ignite the
already too inflammable cupidity of the pedlar. A hint
was enough. From that hour the watch was doomed.
Seeing that his words had had their effect, he applauded
the determination of the pedlar, and added that though
he had no interest in mixing himself up in such affairs,
yet he liked to encourage enterprising men, and he
himself would furnish him with the means of making
his booty doubly sure, and without which he represented
it would be madness to make the attempt.</p>

<p>He showed him that John Archer always carried a
gun with him, that he was a hot-tempered young fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and would shoot him as soon as look at him if he
attempted and failed.</p>

<p>"One must use all one's resources, in case of need,"
he added, and suggested that the securest way to obtain
the watch would be to administer to Archer a glass of
drugged wine, which he might easily induce the unsuspecting
youth to accept. This drug (which De Chevron
had in his possession and which was probably concocted
by his friend and ally, Madge Mandrake) produced
instantaneous sleep for full five hours on the person
partaking of it. It was agreed then that the pedlar
should carry in his coat pocket a bottle of the said
drugged wine, together with a wine glass, that towards
evening he should wander about a certain unfrequented
road which bordered on Lord Edgedown's estate, and
near which Archer was sure to be at a certain hour.</p>

<p>Should he catch sight of John Archer, he was to
accost him civilly, invite him to converse, then after a
time produce the bottle and glass and say that he had
some dozens of very choice wine which if he (John
Archer) could only induce his lordship to buy that it
would be the making of his fortune. He would then
pour out a glassful, which he would offer the young
gamekeeper to try himself; should he refuse, he was to
press him so urgently that he would at length be forced
to comply.</p>

<p>When Archer should have once tossed off the glass,
Mike would wait some moments until he was in a perfectly
sound sleep, when he would be enabled to steal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
not only his watch and what else he might have in his
pockets, but also his gun.</p>

<p>The pedlar jumped at the proposition, and armed
with his bottle of drugged wine, he set off the selfsame
evening for the spot agreed upon, followed at a distance
by De Chevron himself, just to give the alarm, as he
suggested, by a sharp shrill whistle, should anyone
approach to interrupt their design.</p>

<p>Backed up by the help of De Chevron, the pedlar
knew no fear, nor did it ever enter his head, so blinded
was he by greed, that De Chevron could possibly have
any object in thus lending him his help.</p>

<p>The evening arrived. It was now about a week
after De Chevron's supposed departure, and so close had
been his confinement to the house all this time, that I
do not believe there was a soul in all the village but
believed that he was absent on business in London at
the time.</p>

<p>As the evening agreed upon drew in, De Chevron,
disguising himself as best he might in a large loose
cloak that he never had been seen to wear and a
hat unlike that he was known by in the village, set out
in the dusk towards the lonely road, following the
pedlar at a considerable distance. The pedlar advanced
towards the spot singing.</p>

<p>"Good morrow, Master Archer," he said, as the
young gamekeeper made his appearance from behind a
hedge, "and how does the world go for you? Easily
enough, eh?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well enough, for the matter of that," replied
Archer, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Ah! you lucky dog, your bread and butter's cut
for life. Wouldn't I like to be in your shoes without
doing you any harm!" said the pedlar.</p>

<p>"Would you?" laughed Archer. "Why, I'm sure
you have no reason to complain of your lot. A pedlar's
is a good business."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't exactly complain," replied the pedlar,
with proud humility; "but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," interrupted Archer, "we all like to be a little
better off than we are. Isn't that it?" asked the gamekeeper,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, I dare say you are not far wrong, Archer my
boy," said the pedlar, wheedlingly. "It's natural you
know, ain't it? By the way, Johnny old fellow, do you
think you could do an old friend a great favour? It
won't cost you anything. I'm not going to ask you to
lend me any money."</p>

<p>"Well," said John, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"Why, the fact is," said Mike, "that I have got
some fine stuffs that will do for curtains or to cover
chairs with. I've got carpets, mattresses, and I don't
know what all. Besides which I have got some
excellent wine, superfine quality, which if you could
induce your master to buy, my fortune would be made."</p>

<p>"It would be useless," answered John Archer.
"His lordship never buys either stuffs or wine from
country hawkers, but has up everything from London."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I suppose he would, you know, a great man
like him. Still, when a good thing comes in your way,
something unique, like this wine of mine, why, it would
be madness to let it slip through your fingers without
even giving it a trial. Look here now." Here he
produced the bottle. "This wine I am in the habit
of always carrying about with me as a sample. Here,
just taste it. It'll do your heart good." Here he
poured out a glass.</p>

<p>"Thank you, no," said Archer.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man," said the pedlar, "what are you afraid of?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Archer, "only I don't care about
it, thank you."</p>

<p>"Drink, drink, man. What's the matter with
you?"</p>

<p>"Drink it yourself, I won't rob you of it," said
John.</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, Jack my boy, I'm not niggardly in
offering my wine, especially when I meet old friends,
you know, besides, I am interested in your tasting this,
because, you see, when you have once drunk this little
glassful you will be better able to speak well of it to
your master, and he <i>might</i> honour me so far as to
purchase a dozen. But, interest apart, take a glass for
old friendship's sake, or I shall take offence. Come, no
excuse; here you are!"</p>

<p>John Archer, wearied out by the pedlar's importunities,
could resist no longer, and suspecting nothing,
tossed off the glass at a gulp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good, indeed," he had barely time to say, as he
gave back the glass. "Gramercy! how is this? My head swims. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was unable to finish his sentence, but fell like a
log to the ground. The pedlar's eyes glistened as he
witnessed the speedy effects of the drug. In another
moment his fingers were fumbling in the waistcoat
pocket of the prostrate John Archer, and he had succeeded
in transferring the watch from the gamekeeper's
pocket to his own.</p>

<p>He then began rifling his other pockets, but there
was little else worth taking on poor John's person&mdash;a
few loose coins, perhaps, nothing more.</p>

<p>At this moment De Chevron came up, and lifting
the gun from the ground, said, "This gun is yours,
Mike."</p>

<p>Then, retreating a few paces behind the pedlar, he
levelled the gun at his head, but not being quite correct
in his aim, the bullet lodged in the man's shoulder.
Mike gave a yell of agony on finding himself wounded,
but he still might have imagined that the gun had gone
off accidentally and had thus hit him in the shoulder,
had not De Chevron immediately come up and with one
tremendous blow on the head from the butt end of the
gun, felled him to the ground.</p>

<p>"Treachery!" feebly gasped out the wretched man.</p>

<p>Then followed a second blow, a third and even a
fourth, until the unhappy dupe spoke no more. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
drag the body to a ditch thickly overgrown with nettles
and brambles which completely concealed it from view
was the work of the moment, having previously
despoiled the corpse of its recently acquired treasure
and restored the same to the pocket of its owner, who
still lay in the arms of Morpheus. Then replacing the
gun by the side of its sleeping master, and bedaubing
the gamekeeper's clothes with blood, he first poured out
the contents of the pedlar's bottle on the grass, then
started homewards.</p>

<p>No one appears to have met him, either before or
after the murder. Circumstances seem to have been
peculiarly favourable to him that evening, for chancing
to be excessively windy at that hour, and the road being
of loose white sand, not a single footprint was to be
discovered the next morning. It was somewhere about
midnight when John Archer woke up from his trance.
His first wonderment was how he got there. He
imagined that he must in some way or other have
become intoxicated. Then he thought of the pedlar.
It was strange, he did not remember having drunk more
than one glass, but it was not until he reached his cot
that he was aware of the plight he was in.</p>

<p>Where did all that blood come from? he asked
himself. He must be wounded he thought. However,
he examined himself all over and could discover
nothing. The barrel of his gun was discharged, too,
and the butt end of it stained with blood. He was
more bewildered than ever. He then related the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
of the circumstances to his parents, who, however,
could not bring themselves to believe otherwise than
that their son must have been intoxicated, although his
character for sobriety was well known.</p>

<p>The blood stains, however, and the discharged barrel
still remained a mystery and became the subject of
much conjecture amongst his friends. The blood, as he
owned himself, did not proceed from any wound he had
received. Whose blood was it then? The butt end of
his gun being stained with blood would argue violence
used against some person or animal.</p>

<p>John was known to be an honest and humane man&mdash;the
very last man in the world to commit murder;
still, under the influence of intoxication he might have
committed a rash act. When questioned as to whether
he remembered anything, he shook his head, and merely
related his interview with the pedlar, from whom he
felt confident of not having accepted more than one
glass of wine. His manner throughout all this questioning
was open and frank, and everyone agreed that,
mysterious as the affair appeared, they were quite sure
that young Archer was innocent of murder.</p>

<p>The day after, however, a waggoner's dog passing
by the scene of the murder was observed by its master
to be sniffing and burrowing in a certain ditch. The
waggoner took no notice of the circumstance at first,
until the dog set up a howl and refused to leave the
spot. It then seemed to be tearing or dragging some
heavy substance with its teeth, and finally succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
leaving bare the body of the pedlar. The pedlar had
already been missed in the village, and the waggoner
at once recognised the body. He lost no time in rousing
the neighbourhood, for he dreaded being discovered
near the corpse, lest he should be implicated in the
murder.</p>

<p>The body of the pedlar was removed to the nearest
cottage, and a surgeon sent for immediately to examine
it. Contrary to everybody's expectation, the surgeon
pronounced that life was not yet extinct, though he
held out no hopes at all of ultimate recovery.</p>

<p>He did all he could do under the circumstances,
gave his instructions to the inmates of the cottage, and
said that he would call again. Then arose the question,
who could be the perpetrator of the deed? Suspicion
immediately attached itself to John Archer.</p>

<p>Witnesses came forward and deposed that they had
met John Archer with blood on his clothes and the
butt end of his rifle also stained with blood. The
wounds on the head of the all-but murdered man
appeared to have been inflicted by the butt end of a
rifle, therefore this was strong evidence; but there was
yet stronger. The bullet having been extracted from
the dying man's shoulder, was at once recognised by all
as belonging to John Archer, his bullets being marked
always in a peculiar manner, added to which it fitted
exactly into the bore of Archer's rifle.</p>

<p>This last evidence was considered conclusive, and
John Archer was conducted off to prison to await his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
trial at the next assizes. Imagine the grief and dismay
of poor John's aged parents, who had looked forward to
his being the prop of their old age, at hearing that their
only son had been arrested on a charge of murder.
Imagine the shame and confusion of John himself, the
surprise and indignation of his intimate friends, including
ourselves, who still believed in his innocence.</p>

<p>As for poor Claribel, she was struck completely
dumb at the news; she could not believe her ears. It
was not for a considerable time that she could realise
the fact; but when she did, she neither fainted, burst
into tears, nor behaved in any way extravagantly. Her
grief was too deeply seated. She moped about the
house with her eyes fixed, as if she were walking in her
sleep. It was just this calm, in a nature like hers, that
I dreaded far more than any violent transport of grief,
for I feared that the shock had been too great for her,
and had turned her brain. What made the affair doubly
painful to her was that the village people had already
begun to couple her name with John Archer's.</p>

<p>Folks speaking of the arrest would say that it was
Claribel Falkland's young man that had been arrested
for murder, although there had never been anything like
an engagement between them.</p>

<p>When she recovered herself somewhat, she said,
"Molly, depend upon it, that De Chevron is at the
bottom of this."</p>

<p>Now, although I knew De Chevron to be a hardened
villain and capable of any atrocity, I did not see myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
how he could possibly be connected with the murder, he
being absent from the village at the time. Neither did
I for a moment believe John Archer capable of the crime.
The evidence against him was singularly unfortunate, it
is true; but no one who knew the man as intimately as
we did could really have believed him guilty. It was
clear that someone must have committed the murder.
Who, then, was likely to have done so?</p>

<p>De Chevron was a villain, we knew, but that was no
proof that he was the murderer. However, I excused
this seeming unreasonableness in my friend, considering
the state of her mind at the time, and merely suggested:</p>

<p>"But he is in London, my dear."</p>

<p>"I tell you he is mixed up in the affair," persisted
Claribel. "I was warned of this in my dream."</p>

<p>"I fear that would have little weight in a court of
justice," I replied.</p>

<p>"De Chevron is the murderer, and no one else,"
she persisted, doggedly.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Claribel," said I, soothingly, "allowing
that he is a wicked, heartless villain, just think for a
moment how you would support your accusation in a
court of law. A pedlar is found murdered in a ditch,
and a gentleman of De Chevron's condition now in
London, where he has been for the last week, is accused
of the murder. Consider the absurdity of the idea."</p>

<p>"How do you know he has been in London all the
time?" asked my friend.</p>

<p>"Well, I grant you, I did not see him go," said I;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
"but when a man gives out that he is going away from
a place, and has not been seen by anyone since,
especially when it is in a little village like this, where
everybody knows everybody else's business, the probability
is that he has left."</p>

<p>"Do not be too sure," said Claribel. "We must
examine into the affair."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is easily done," said I; "but even should
he not have departed, if he should have changed his
mind and remained here, what does that prove?
Besides, what motive could a gentleman have in taking
the life of a poor, unknown, itinerant pedlar?"</p>

<p>"To lay the blame on John Archer, his rival, and
get him into trouble," was my friend's reply. "Do you
not think him capable?"</p>

<p>"I think him capable of anything that's bad," said I;
"but that's not the point. You must, first of all, have
reason enough on your side to prove that he did, which
you have not. Look, now, at the evidence against
young Archer. A young man returns home to his
family after midnight, his clothes disordered and bloodstained,
his gun discharged, and the butt end of it
clotted with blood. When questioned, he is unable to
give any satisfactory account of himself. Says he
remembers nothing but having accepted one glass of
wine from a pedlar. He relates that he woke up
towards midnight and discovered that he had been sleeping
for hours in the open air, near to the spot where
the body of the pedlar is found on the day following.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>"His friends do not believe him guilty because,
forsooth, he has earned a reputation for truthfulness,
steadiness, and sobriety; yet might not the opposite
party contend that it was not impossible that he might,
once in his life, have broken through his custom of
rigid abstinence, and in a moment of intoxication, picking
a quarrel with the pedlar, first discharged his gun at
him&mdash;for, remember that the bullet extracted from the
pedlar's shoulder has been recognised as Archer's
bullet&mdash;and afterwards, finding his adversary not
mortally wounded, had hastened his death by knocking
out his brains with the butt end of his rifle. That he
had afterwards himself fallen into a drunken sleep and
entirely forgotten the events of the preceding evening is
not at all impossible. This would be the more charitable
way of looking at the affair; but, alas, there is
another circumstance that puts it in a more serious light,
and that is the hiding of the body. The body has been
discovered in a ditch, carefully concealed from view by
weeds and brambles. This argues reason. Is it probable
that a man who commits homicide in a drunken
brawl, being so drunk at the time as to fall down on the
damp ground and sleep there the whole night through,
that he should have been sufficiently master of himself
to drag off the body of his victim and successfully conceal
it from view in an overgrown ditch?"</p>

<p>"I cannot and will not believe him so base as to be
guilty of wilful murder, neither will I believe that he
committed homicide in a fit of intoxication. If he took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the pedlar's life at all&mdash;I say <i>if</i> he did&mdash;why, then I
lean towards the belief that he did it whilst under some
evil spell of Richard de Chevron's. What do you
believe, Molly?"</p>

<p>"No matter, dear, what I believe," said I; "I am a
woman, like yourself, and too likely to be influenced by
my feelings. I do not wish to believe him guilty, and
should be very much surprised and horror-struck if he
really were so, after the good opinion we all have had of
him. But all that goes for nothing. I merely tell you
how the world will judge him."</p>

<p>Poor Claribel could not help seeing that it was likely
to go hard with John.</p>

<p>"Oh! if they should condemn him unjustly and
execute him!" she cried, in agony.</p>

<p>Poor child! It was all I could do to comfort her.
I told her the law was not rash in condemning anyone
to death; that inquiries would be made, that the real
perpetrator of the deed could not fail to be discovered,
sooner or later, when he would suffer the penalty of the
law, and the innocent man be acquitted. I had
attempted to excite hopes in her that I myself dared
hardly entertain, and that she, poor child, I could see,
looked upon as poor consolation.</p>

<p>We both retired to rest that night with heavy hearts,
but the next morning Claribel woke up with a smile on
her face, although she looked very pale and worn.</p>

<p>"Molly, dear, I saw him last night," she said.</p>

<p>"Did you, really? What, John Archer?" I asked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
for I no longer now doubted her word when she spoke
in this manner.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "and I promised to call again to
give him consolation."</p>

<p>"How did you manage to speak to him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"By signs only; but he understood me."</p>

<p>"Was he asleep?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No; he was tossing restlessly on his pallet."</p>

<p>"Then he could not possibly imagine he had been
dreaming."</p>

<p>"I think not, as this is the second time I have
appeared to him in the spirit."</p>

<p>"I remember you told me once before that you had
seen him, and he himself confirmed it, although I know
that you never left the house that day. But, tell me,
did no one see you enter?"</p>

<p>"What matter if they did? Bolts and bars are no
obstacles to a spirit."</p>

<p>"And you passed through prison walls and bolted
doors without opposition?"</p>

<p>"I did, and I promised that I should be with him
again in his cell as the clock struck two, so that he
might be quite sure that he had not been dreaming."</p>

<p>"You will keep your appointment, of course?" I
said.</p>

<p>"If I do not, I do not know who it will be that
will prevent me."</p>

<p>Here our conversation ceased, and we passed our
time as usual until it drew towards two o'clock in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
afternoon, when my friend suddenly stopped in the
middle of talking and said,</p>

<p>"Do not disturb me, Molly dear, or allow anyone
else to. I am going to John."</p>

<p>Then throwing herself back in an arm-chair, she
appeared almost immediately in a sound sleep, resembling
a swoon. I then observed, as it were, two
outlines to her form, for a cloudy substance like a halo
began to envelop her, which, widening as it rose
upwards, from the body began to solidify or partially so,
and to assume the exact form and features of Claribel.
Having separated itself from her person, it passed
rapidly before my face like a gust of wind, causing my
hair to stir and crackle as if singed with a candle,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
and passing head foremost through the window with
inconceivable velocity was instantly lost to my view.</p>

<p>An indescribable feeling of horror passed over me
at being left thus alone with what appeared to be the
corpse of my friend. The next moment my father
entered the room, and fearing lest he should wake my
friend in the middle of her trance by his talking, I ran
to the door and begged he would not enter, as Claribel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
felt rather poorly and he might awake her, so he
prudently retired to another room, when I gently turned
the key of the door and kept watch close to the clay of
my friend until the spirit should return to re-animate it.</p>

<p>Let us now take a peep at John in prison. Poor
fellow! He had not slept a wink all night. He rose
worn and languid. Disdaining his frugal breakfast of
bread and water, with arms folded, eyes fixed and head
sunk upon his breast, he paced dejectedly up and down
the narrow limits of his cell.</p>

<p>"Is this John Archer?" he soliloquised. "Is this
the man once surrounded by friends, the hope and
pride of his parents, the favoured servant of Lord
Edgedown, honoured and respected by all, now handcuffed
and led off to prison on a charge of murder to
await an ignominious trial, and probably be condemned
to hang by the neck till he is dead in the presence of a
jeering rabble? It cannot be. I must be transformed.
I must be dreaming. This is not John Archer. Is
John Archer a murderer? Can I really have committed
a murder in a state of delirium which has obliterated
all recollection of the crime committed? It must be so.
How else could I have slept all night on the bare
ground and on awaking find my gun discharged, my
clothes bloodstained, and even the butt end of my rifle
besmeared with blood?</p>

<p>"How is all this to be accounted for? I must have
committed murder. Who will believe me if I assert my
innocence, or how will the law be brought to look upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
the crime as committed during temporary insanity?
No; I shall be found guilty, condemned, and executed.
I do believe that the vision of last night that appeared
to me bearing the form and features of Claribel was my
guardian angel come to apprise me of my doom.</p>

<p>"Oh, Claribel, Claribel! must we then for ever be
parted? But what was that vision? Claribel in the
flesh? For so it appeared; for sure it was no dream, yet
how could that be? Could she herself have broken
through bolts and bars or obtained a pass to speak to
me alone? Impossible! Was it, perchance, some
fiend having taken upon himself the likeness of those
divine features in order so to mock me? Or was it merely
an hallucination of my distempered brain? Whatever
it was, I would that it were here again so that I might
feast my eyes once more upon its lovely features ere
I die."</p>

<p>He paused suddenly, for now, whether it were some
trick of the senses, some hallucination conjured up by
his over-excited brain, in the opposite corner of his cell
something like a bluish vapour appeared, which seemed
to grow denser, to solidify until it grew into the
semblance of a human form, bearing the features of&mdash;whom?</p>

<p>"Claribel!" gasped out the prisoner, hardly above
his breath, for his voice died within him and he
remained awe-stricken. "What! Do I rave? Oh,
beauteous image! Claribel! Claribel! Tell me, oh,
my guardian angel, hast thou come to announce my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
doom, to solace my last moments? Oh, if it be thou
indeed, Claribel, in the flesh and no delusion of my
senses, come to me, let me feel the pressure of thy hand."</p>

<p>At this moment he sprang forward and attempted
to seize the hand of the figure, which he had no sooner
touched than it melted in his grasp, causing him to feel
such a supernatural terror that he staggered backwards
and gave an involuntary shriek.</p>

<p>The figure put its finger to its lip, the forefinger of
the very hand that had vanished into thin air at the
material touch of John Archer, but which had immediately
resumed its previously defined form upon the
withdrawing of Archer's hand.</p>

<p>"Angel or fiend!" he exclaimed. "Whatever thou
art, that comest to me in this lovely guise, declare thy
mission, unveil to me the future, and spare not mine
ears if my doom be sealed. If there be hope&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the figure again put its finger to its lip in
token of silence, for Archer, now somewhat over his first
surprise, spoke no longer in a husky whisper, but in a
loud voice.</p>

<p>"Tell me, tell me," continued the prisoner, lowering
his voice, "thou who seemest no being of this world,
and who doubtless art cognisant of secrets beyond our
ken, tell me in pity how I have deserved this fate. Say,
have these hands really been dyed in the blood of one
of my fellow-men during the lapse of some passing
insanity? Say, why am I here? Dost thou, O spirit,
think me guilty?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>The phantom answered not, save by a look of
commiseration and a slow shake of the head.</p>

<p>"I see that thou thinkest me not guilty. I thank
thee for that. Mine innocence may yet be proved."</p>

<p>The spectre's features lighted up with a look of hope,
as if it would answer "I wish it may."</p>

<p>"Angelic being!" he pursued, "vouchsafe me but
one word. Say, will the true murderer be found?"</p>

<p>Another look of hope lighted up the spirit's features.</p>

<p>"He will, he will; I feel he will!" exclaimed the
prisoner, enthusiastically. "Thank Heaven! But one
word more. Dost know the criminal?"</p>

<p>The same look again, accompanied this time by a
slight inclination of the head.</p>

<p>"Ah! thou knowest him? His name, his name;
tell me!" Here the figure appeared somewhat confused,
as if struggling to speak; then gliding rather
than walking up to the wall of the cell, it traced with its
finger the letters of a name in characters that appeared
burnt into the stone, during which operation a crackling
sound was heard similar to that before alluded to, and
Archer, who had watched the movements of the figure
with straining eyeballs and in breathless silence, gave a
yell of surprise and agony as he read the name <i>Richard
de Chevron</i>, and sank on the floor of his dungeon in
a swoon.</p>

<p>A jingling of keys in the passage was now audible,
and the next moment the jailor had entered the cell.
Hearing the voice of the prisoner discoursing loudly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
curiosity had led him to the door of his cell, but what
was his dismay and consternation at finding the prisoner
in a swoon on the floor, whilst over him, as if to protect
him, lent the fair youthful form of a maiden, who after
fixing her eyes intently for a moment, pointed to the
writing on the wall.</p>

<p>The jailor, perfectly dumbfounded, would have
asked her in surly tones, how she came there, and who
let her in, but the presence of the figure filled him, in
spite of himself, with such awe that he could not utter
a word. Then glancing at the writing on the wall and
then again at the figure of the maiden, who looked at
him in a manner that made him feel he knew not how,
as he afterwards declared, he observed her rise to her
feet, retreat one pace, and pointing once more to the
writing on the wall, gradually dissolved herself into
a mist and disappeared from his sight.</p>

<p>The jailor's courage now fairly left him, his knees
knocked together in a panic, and he dropped his bunch
of keys on the ground. At length recovering from his
first surprise, he gazed around him, and found himself
alone with the prisoner, who was still in his swoon.
The first thing that he did was to secure the door of the
cell, then walking up to the prisoner, shook him
roughly, and assailed him with questions.</p>

<p>"Beautiful vision!" cried Archer, now awaking
from his swoon, "thou has saved my life by denouncing
the true murderer. Were it not for thee I might&mdash;&mdash; But
where art thou? Gone&mdash;Fled? Has it, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
been all a dream? Oh!" he groaned, as his eyes
caught the jailor bending over him.</p>

<p>"Come, be of good cheer, young man," said the
jailor, kindly. "It was no dream, or if it was, we have
both been dreaming, and had the same dream. I, too,
saw the lady. I'll swear to that in any court of justice.
Well, I never believed in ghosts before, young man. I
never did, upon my word, but after what I have just
seen with these eyes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! you saw her, too?" interrupted Archer.
"You? Then it was no dream, but a divine vision
sent by Providence to preserve the innocent. Look,
there is her writing on the wall."</p>

<p>"What means that name, young man?" asked the
jailor, gravely.</p>

<p>"She traced it with her own finger. I asked her to
reveal to me the name of the true murderer, and that
was the name she traced upon the wall."</p>

<p>"You are not imposing upon me, young man?"
inquired the jailor, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Not I," answered Archer, frankly. "Did you not
see her yourself?"</p>

<p>"True, true," quoth the jailor; "I remember that
she pointed to the writing and then vanished. Well,
upon my soul, I do not know what to think of the
matter. I have been here thirty years come Michaelmas,
but what I have seen to-day passes all the experience
of Miles Gratelock. I'll inform the authorities of
what has taken place at once, and I'll yet hope to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
you out of this place; for to tell you the honest truth,
lad, I don't think you capable of the murder, and never
did; yet appearances," he added, "appearances, you
know, must be taken into consideration, and they are
often against us. However, we'll hope for the best."</p>

<p>Here the kindly jailor left the cell, and locking the
door after him went straight to the authorities and laid
the whole matter of the vision before them. As may
be anticipated, the story was ridiculed. Some said that
the jailor had been bribed by the prisoner to concoct
such a narrative; others declared that the jailor must
have been drunk, and having forgotten to lock the door
of the cell some young female may have found admittance,
and to cover his negligence he had trumped up
this improbable story.</p>

<p>They, however, took the trouble to visit the cell of
the prisoner and to examine the writing on the wall,
which they all declared themselves to be at a loss to
guess with what material the prisoner himself could
have written the name. The prisoner was questioned
and cross-questioned, but was not found to contradict
himself in anything. A piece of chalk was then put into
the prisoner's hand and he was ordered to write the
same name underneath that supposed to have been
written by the spirit, but the handwriting was perfectly
dissimilar. The jailor was then called, and had to do
the same, but neither in this case did the writing at all
resemble the burnt characters on the wall.</p>

<p>Now, however mysterious this affair might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
appeared to the authorities, yet to convict a gentleman
of De Chevron's standing, or indeed any man upon such
evidence as this, would be as absurd as it would be
unfair; nevertheless, the story of the apparition in the
prisoner's cell and of the writing on the wall spread like
wildfire through the village, and had the effect of
shaking the belief of many who had hitherto believed
Archer guilty, and confirming more than ever in their
previous belief those who still maintained him innocent.</p>

<p>The general currency of this story, too, gave rise to
inquiries as to the intimacy that had existed between
John Archer and De Chevron. A certain amount of
intimacy it was proved had existed between them, but
so far the evidence was rather on De Chevron's side, as
witnesses came forward to prove that De Chevron had
always shown himself most friendly towards young
Archer, and had occasionally made him some trifling
present.</p>

<p>There was no evidence that they had ever fallen out
together, and therefore there was no reason at all to
suspect De Chevron of the malicious conduct attributed
to him of committing a murder himself in order that an
innocent man should be convicted of it. To strengthen
the absurdity of the supposition, it was alleged that De
Chevron had been absent in London at the time of the
murder, thereby proving an <i>alibi</i>. Others not being
satisfied with this statement, desired that it should be
proved beyond doubt that De Chevron was in London
at the time. Upon examination, however, the evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
was not quite so favourable to De Chevron this time.
More than one witness deposed to having seen him at
the window, although he had not been seen out of
doors. It was proved that he had never quitted the
village, although he had given out to his friends his
intention of going to London; but he sought to exculpate
himself by saying that he had announced to his
friends his intended departure for London in order that
he might avoid visits and enjoy the strictest seclusion
for a time, as he was studying for the law.</p>

<p>This excuse was deemed sufficient, and might have
satisfied all parties, had not still more startling evidence
turned up. In the meantime the all but defunct pedlar
had sufficiently recovered in order to give a detailed
account of the occurrences on the night of the murder,
and of De Chevron's duplicity and treachery, although
he owned himself at a loss to conceive the motive of
the attempted murder.</p>

<p>He acquitted John Archer of being implicated in
any way in the crime, and denounced De Chevron
as a double-dealing murderous villain. His evidence
was taken down in writing by the surgeon who attended
him, in the presence of several witnesses, and it was
proposed that both John Archer and De Chevron
should be confronted with the dying man.</p>

<p>This was accordingly done. The half-murdered
pedlar managed to sustain life by an almost preternatural
effort until the arrival of the two individuals.
Upon the appearance of De Chevron his eye kindled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
with an incredible animation, considering his dying
state, and although his utterance was now difficult, he
succeeded in denouncing him as his murderer in sufficiently
plain terms to be understood by all present.
When his eye caught John Archer, the dying man
stretched forth his hand to him, craved his pardon for
the evil he had done him, but adding that it was all at
the instigation of De Chevron, for the carrying out of
some private scheme of his own. De Chevron endeavoured
to justify himself, alleging that the man
raved and that such testimony could not be depended
upon. The pedlar, however, had given his evidence so
clearly and concisely that it was accounted valid, after
which he sank back and expired.</p>

<p>Now, whilst the evidence of the pedlar that had been
taken down was being read out mention was made of
the bottle of drugged wine said to have been given to
the pedlar by De Chevron in order to carry out his base
designs. A search was accordingly made for the bottle,
which, being found, though empty&mdash;or, rather, nearly
so&mdash;it was taken to a chemist, who found sufficient of
the liquor left to analyse, which, when done, it was
pronounced to contain narcotics of the most potent
sort.</p>

<p>The house of De Chevron was next searched, and in a
secret drawer of his desk was discovered a powder which
upon being examined proved to contain similar ingredients
to those discovered in the dregs of the wine at the
bottom of the bottle. Besides this powder were found at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
De Chevron's lodgings sundry bottles of wine, all bearing
exactly the same label as that found in the ditch
close to the murdered man.</p>

<p>This evidence was considered conclusive, and De
Chevron was seized for the purpose of being conducted
to prison; but, despairing now of ever getting acquitted,
and dreading to fall into the hands of justice, the miserable
man suddenly drew out a pistol from his pocket,
and holding the barrel to his forehead blew out his
brains on the spot.</p>

<p>This last rash deed of De Chevron's caused even
more sensation in the village and the parts adjacent than
the mysterious murder of the pedlar. The wretched
suicide was interred without obsequies in the centre of
two cross roads, with a stake driven through his body,
according to the usual custom.</p>

<p>I need not say that John Archer was freely acquitted,
and welcomed once more among us with hearty cheers.
Even those who had been the most bitter against him at
first now came forward to extend to him the hand of
friendship.</p>

<p>How the poor lad seemed to enjoy his liberty
after his incarceration! But yesterday imprisoned
for murder, shunned by all his friends and hated by
everybody, with the prospect of an ignominious death
before him. To-day openly acquitted, restored to the
bosom of his family, surrounded by his friends, and
receiving their congratulations. In an instant he had
forgotten all his past woes, and thought himself amply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
compensated for all his suffering by being again allowed
to visit his lady-love.</p>

<p>I will leave you to imagine, gentlemen, the joy of us
all, and especially of Claribel, at John's acquittal, as well
as the importunate questioning of the neighbours concerning
the apparition of Claribel to John within the
prison cell.</p>

<p>There are many people who profess to know their
neighbours' business better than they do themselves.
According to this sort of people&mdash;and there are many in
the village to this day&mdash;John Archer's marriage with
Claribel Falkland was a thing already settled. The day
had been fixed upon, and all was in order&mdash;in fact the
kindly neighbours had made everything as easy as
possible for the young couple, whereas John had never
yet opened his lips in the way of love to the idol of his
heart, being, as I have before mentioned, of a shy and
reserved temperament. Yet so sure were the neighbours
of John's private affairs, that one of his friends said
jocularly that when their banns should be published in
church that he would stand up and forbid them, as in
marrying Claribel he would be committing bigamy, seeing
that she could make herself two persons at once.
Would that the neighbours had been in the right as to
the future of this pair, for a couple better suited for each
other could not have been found; but, alas, who is
master of his fate? Who can pry into the secret ways
of Providence? It little boots to speculate on what the
future of these two amiable and ingenuous natures would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
have been if everything had gone well, for a dire fate
was in store for them. But let me not anticipate.</p>

<p>It was a winter morning, but remarkably fine for that
time of the year, when Claribel and I went out together
for a ramble in an adjacent wood. We had been laughing
and chatting by the way, when suddenly I observed
the features of my friend to become overcast. When I
inquired the reason of her sadness, she replied,</p>

<p>"I know not how it is, Molly, but somehow or other
I feel as if some danger were threatening John."</p>

<p>Now, I had long ceased to laugh at her for what I
used to look upon as mere nervous fancies, so many of
them having proved well founded, but I merely suggested
to her that perhaps she did not feel well, and that
we had better return home.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Molly," she said; "for Heaven's sake let
us return at once, as I feel more and more sure that
poor John is in some danger. You remember my presentiment
about Richard de Chevron, which you laughed
at. Was that well founded or not? Well, as I felt
certain then that some harm was in store for John, so
do I now. Come, let us hasten our steps."</p>

<p>"God forbid," said I, "that poor John should fall a
victim a second time to treachery or witchcraft," and we
hurried home, never halting until we reached my father's
house.</p>

<p>On entering the parlour Claribel gave a hasty glance
at the glazed cupboard where she had placed the waxen
image intended as a likeness of John Archer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
which she had not looked at for ever so long. It was
wanting.</p>

<p>"Molly!" she cried, in great anxiety, "where is the
waxen image? What can have become of it? Just ask
your father if he has removed it."</p>

<p>Now, being winter time, there was a blazing fire in
the room, and my father, who was at this time laid up
with the gout, would draw himself up to it and smoke
his yard of clay. He was absent from the parlour when
we entered, but we found his chair ready placed for him.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Molly, what's this?" cried Claribel,
in alarm, as she touched the mantelpiece over the fireplace.
"Can it be? No; yes, it <i>is</i>&mdash;<i>the waxen image
molten away</i>! Who can have done it? Oh, wretched
being that I am! Go, and at once, to the house of
John, and inquire after his health."</p>

<p>I was preparing to execute her commission, and was
just upon setting out alone to John's house, which was
not far from our own, when one of the neighbours, a
woman&mdash;one of the most notorious gossips of the place,
whose sole delight was to be the first to deliver bad
news&mdash;met me at the door as I was just going out.</p>

<p>"Oh, Molly my dear, have you heard the sad news?
Lack-a-day! who'd have thought it? Oh, lauk-a-daisy-me!
poor Claribel! how she will take on about it to
be sure!"</p>

<p>"Speak out, woman!" cried Claribel, from the
parlour, for she had heard every word through the open
door. "Speak out. What has happened?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh Lord! my dear, that poor young man John
Archer, as you appears to have been so fond of well,
my dear, he's gone&mdash;yes, <i>dead</i>, struck down by a sudden
fever, they say&mdash;in the very spring-time of his youth;
it's hardly a quarter of an hour since, so I thought I'd
come at once to tell you."</p>

<p>This communication, partly interrupted by sobs and
partly by want of breath, for the bearer of the sad news
had set off as fast as her legs could carry her, in order
to be the first to communicate it, had a terrible effect
on the nervous system of my poor friend Claribel.
Forgetting her usual self-composure in her extreme
anguish, she gave utterance to a shriek so piercing and
doleful, that it seemed to shake the very house to its
foundations, and sank back into the nearest chair in a
swoon. The scream brought my father to the door to
inquire what was the matter, while the good neighbour&mdash;for
in spite of her mania for delivering bad news, she
was still a woman at heart&mdash;bustled about to procure
restoratives and to sprinkle water on my poor friend's
face until she recovered.</p>

<p>The news we had heard was only too true, for, sad
to relate, poor John Archer, who up to that very morning
had been the picture of robust health, suddenly fell
the victim of a violent fever that carried him off within a
few hours. The doctors were at a loss to account for
the disease, as there was no fever at that time in the
neighbourhood. It was an isolated case. During his
delirium he was heard to give vent to certain incoherent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
ravings, frequently calling out, "The waxen image! the
waxen image!" He was heard to couple the names of
De Chevron and Madge Mandrake together, but the
bystanders, his parents, understood nothing of his
meaning.</p>

<p>There remains little more to relate. It appears that
my father when left alone in the house had been prying
into every nook and corner of it for his snuff-box, which
he had lost, until he stumbled upon the little waxen
image in the glazed cupboard, of the history of which he
knew nothing, but which he instantly recognised as
intended for a likeness of John Archer, imagining that
either myself or Claribel had been amusing ourselves
with endeavouring to represent the lineaments of our
common friend in wax, and thinking it very good and
clever, he thought it would make a pretty chimney
ornament, and accordingly placed it on the mantelpiece
when the fire was yet low. Afterwards, he had heaped
on fuel, being very cold that day, and shortly afterwards
had been called away by a neighbour on business. In
the meantime the fire had blazed up and so heated the
room that before he returned to the parlour there was
nothing left of the effigy of John Archer but a shapeless
heap of wax.</p>

<p>On recovering from the swoon my poor friend
reproached herself in the severest terms with not
having foreseen such a contingency, adding that she
alone had been the cause of John's death, as she ought
to have locked the cupboard and taken away the key.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
I strove to reason with her and comfort her, but she
was deaf to all consolation. The sad event of John's
death had cast a gloom over us all. As for Claribel,
poor soul, it was a shock from which she never
recovered. She drooped and pined away from that
hour, and outlived young Archer but one month.
Peace be to their ashes!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On concluding her affecting narrative, our worthy
hostess thrust a corner of her apron into her eye in
order to staunch a rising tear called into existence by
tender recollections of her poor deceased friend and her
unfortunate lover, but she was soon cut short in the
indulgence of her grief by the boisterous applause that
simultaneously ensued from all the members of the
club. This was the cheering and clapping of hands
before alluded to that had attracted the attention of
our artist while painting from the fair Helen in the
opposite room, and which, as our reader will recollect,
was the signal for the young portrait painter to commence
his Italian story of "The Three Pauls."</p>

<p>"And so that rascal De Chevron cheated the
gallows after all," broke in Mr. Oldstone, during the
pause that succeeded the tumultuous cheering that
greeted the relation of Dame Hearty.</p>

<p>"But what became of Madge Mandrake? You
have not told us that. She didn't escape scot-free,
surely?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, sir, the law had no actual hold on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
her," replied the hostess; "but I have every reason to
believe that she died hard. She was discovered dead
one day on the floor of her hovel, in her day clothes,
her eyes fixed and starting from her head, her features
distorted, and her fingers extended like claws, as if
grasping the floor. Some thought she had died in a
fit, but, whatever the cause of her death, it is certain
she must have suffered great agony, and I cannot look
upon the mode of her death otherwise than as a judgment
for her many sins. She had never been known to
enter a church within the memory of man, and though
she had led a notoriously bad life, it seems that the parish
could not deny her a Christian burial, and she was interred
in the old churchyard yonder with all due ceremony,
but report said at the time that she had frequently been
seen since by those who happened to be passing through
the churchyard late at night or thereabouts, and that
should a thunderstorm burst over the head of the
benighted traveller, as he wended his weary steps past
this abode of the dead, a shadowy form with a steeple-crowned
hat and astride on a broomstick might be
seen riding through the murky air, and behind her a
black tom cat with a pair of flame-coloured eyes. Yells
and groans, mingled with demoniacal laughter, were said
to have been heard, as if proceeding from beneath the
ground by those who happened to pass through the
churchyard close to her grave after nightfall. Owls,
bats, carrion crows, and other obscene birds would
be found perched on the head of her grave, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
scared at the footsteps of a stranger, would fly screeching
away.</p>

<p>"At least, this is what the country folk would say;
but never having seen nor heard any of these things
myself, gentlemen, I cannot vouch for their authenticity,
yet there are few folks in the village to this day but
would not put themselves much out of the way in order
to avoid passing through that same churchyard on a
stormy night."</p>

<p>"In fact," remarked Mr. Crucible, "there is every
reason to believe that the old lady was d&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A storm had for some time past been gathering
overhead, and just then a terrific clap of thunder
prevented the conclusion of Mr. Crucible's sentence
from being audible.</p>

<p>"Lauk-a-daisy-me! what a peal!" exclaimed Dame
Hearty. "It was enough to shake the house down.
I'm terrible frightened of thunder. It makes me feel
alloverish like."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," suggested Mr. Blackdeed, "if
old Madge on her broomstick should be riding overhead.
Just go out and see, Dame Hearty, will you?"</p>

<p>"Not I, sir, not for the world," quoth our hostess.
"And pray don't talk of that horrible person in such
weather, or I shall go off in a fit. Already I begin to
fancy I see her before me, with her nose and chin
meeting like a lobster's claws, with hardly room enough
between them for a decent-sized hazel nut.</p>

<p>"How I can call to mind, too, her grizzly beard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
like a well-used scrubbing brush, that left you in doubt
as to whether she really could belong to our sex!
Then her beetle brows overhanging her sockets like a
dragoon's moustache, and all but concealing her small
deeply-sunk and viperish eyes, which gleamed with
envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness."</p>

<p>"There, did you see that flash!" exclaimed Dr.
Bleedem. "Just wait a moment; here it comes."</p>

<p>A second tremendous crash resounded, causing the
window panes to revibrate and the whole house to rock
to its foundations.</p>

<p>"Lord have mercy upon us!" cried the hostess in
extreme terror.</p>

<p>"That is a judgment sent on you by old Madge for
speaking ill of her," said Professor Cyanite.</p>

<p>"Oh! hold your tongue, naughty man, do," said our
hostess, half playfully, half in terror. "Here comes the
rain in torrents. How it pours! Well, gentlemen, if
you'll excuse me, I've got to attend to the house."</p>

<p>"Certainly," cried several members at once, "and
many thanks for your very interesting story."</p>

<p>Our hostess curtseyed, said they were very welcome,
and left the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>In which occurs Mr. Parnassus' Ballad&mdash;The
Chieftain's Destiny.</h3>

<p>"Wretched weather, eh?" remarked Mr. Oldstone.
"We shall have to call for lights soon. Here, Cyanite,
a game of chess, what do you say? A story from whom
ever loses."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied the Professor, "but I have a
letter to write which is of some importance."</p>

<p>"Come now, Crucible, have at <i>you</i>," quoth Oldstone.</p>

<p>"I have not played for years," replied Crucible,
"and as I have no story wherewith to pay the penalty
and am consequently out of practice and sure to lose
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you say, Blackdeed?" asked Oldstone.</p>

<p>"Well, to say the truth," answered the chemist, "I
find myself much in the same position as my friend
Mr. Crucible, for were I to lose, an event which amounts
to a dead certainty, I am perfectly sure I should not be
able to pay the forfeit, even if I were to be imprisoned
for it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll oblige me, Hardcase," said the
antiquary.</p>

<p>"Another time, thank you, Oldstone," replied the
lawyer; "but the fact is that I've promised Bleedem a
game of cards."</p>

<p>"Well really, gentlemen, I don't know what has
come over you all," said Mr. Oldstone. "Perhaps Mr.
Parnassus will oblige me, as nobody else will."</p>

<p>"Well, I never piqued myself upon being much of
a chess-player," replied Parnassus, "but as the other
gentlemen have refused, and I have nothing particular
to do, I don't mind doing you a favour, and if I lose and
don't happen to recollect a story, well I must owe it
you."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Oldstone. "Draw your chair to the
table and set the board."</p>

<p>The game began. Hardcase and Bleedem also had
taken their seats and commenced theirs. Professor
Cyanite retired to write his letter, whilst Messrs. Blackdeed
and Crucible drew their chairs up to the fire and
talked politics.</p>

<p>A stillness reigned through the club as the last-mentioned
gentlemen conversed together in a low tone
and the rest remained absorbed in their several occupations.
Suddenly, in the midst of this unusual silence,
the triumphant voice of Mr. Oldstone was heard to cry
out the magic word, "check-mate."</p>

<p>"Now then, Parnassus, my boy," said he, rubbing
his hands, "a story, you know; there's no getting out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
it. Give us a little ode or ballad like that you gave us
once before, on the night of our grand saturnalia."</p>

<p>"When I can think of one and a propitious moment
presents itself, I am at your service, but these gentlemen,
you see, are otherwise occupied; besides, here comes
Helen to lay the cloth for supper."</p>

<p>"Well, Helen," cried Mr. Oldstone, "and what has
become of your enamoured portrait painter?"</p>

<p>"Mr. McGuilp?" inquired Helen, blushing deeply.
"Is he not here? I left him some time ago cleaning
his palette and brushes."</p>

<p>"Ah! here he comes at last," exclaimed Crucible,
halting in the middle of his politics. "Lucky dog! to
be able to have so much beauty all to himself."</p>

<p>"Well, if he <i>has</i> had Helen to himself all this time,
we've had a story during his absence," said the
antiquary.</p>

<p>"Ah, but so have we," said McGuilp. "Haven't we
Helen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we have indeed, and a long one," replied
Helen.</p>

<p>"The deuce you have," said Crucible. "Upon my
word, Mr. McGuilp, I think that's hardly fair; first
robbing us of our lady and then telling her a story all
to yourself, from which we are debarred."</p>

<p>"Come now," retorted McGuilp, "are we not
quits? Have you already forgotten my story of the
'Scharfrichter,' with which I purchased a sitting from
Helen? If Helen and I have had a story together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
from which you have been shut out, at least you have
had one that we have not enjoyed."</p>

<p>"Yes, Crucible, I think it is all fair," said Oldstone,
backing up his young friend.</p>

<p>The cloth now being laid, the members drew their
chairs to the table, and the supper went off amidst
laughter and jovial conversation. The bottle went
round a few times at the last before the cloth was
finally cleared, when each drew round the fire, which
was now blazing fiercely, our host having just put on a
fresh log, and each lighting his pipe, waited, according
to custom, for someone to broach a new story.</p>

<p>"Now, Parnassus, my boy," said Oldstone, "we are
quite ready for your story. What is it to be?"</p>

<p>"Well then, gentlemen, since I must pay my forfeit,
I will, according to a wish expressed by Mr. Oldstone,
sing you a little ballad of my own composing."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; hear, hear! A song, a song! Make
ready for a song."</p>

<p>The members re-settled themselves on their chairs,
and pronounced themselves "all attention," while the
young poet, throwing himself back carelessly in his
chair and crossing one leg over the other, began in a
clear rich voice, the following ditty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarce had the last word of the song died in the
echo, than unbounded applause once more shook the
old panelled walls of the "Headless Lady." After
which Mr. Oldstone, rising and seizing the young poet
by the hand, poured forth so warm an eulogium on his
poetical talent as to make that young gentleman blush
up to the roots of his hair.</p>

<p>The laurel crown was even hinted at again. This,
however, Mr. Parnassus modestly but firmly refused,
saying that he could not sit crowned in the midst of such
a talented assembly merely because his weak endeavours
to entertain the company were given out in rhyme
instead of in prose; besides which, he added, that he
had merely paid the forfeit agreed upon for losing at
chess, and that he was entitled to no thanks or marks of
honour for merely discharging his debt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>The laurel tree outside was therefore suffered to continue
its growth until some future occasion, and after
various comments on our friend Parnassus' poem, and
much pleasant conversation, the company broke up for
the night, and each lighting his candle, retired to his
own chamber.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>A Tale of the French Revolution.&mdash;The
Barber's Story.</h3>

<p>The following morning broke fine but frosty, and the
members of the club being up sufficiently early for that
time of the year, they all agreed to take a long stroll
before breakfast in the adjacent wood. Indeed, the
members of our club lived so thoroughly in an atmosphere
of punch and tobacco-smoke that an outing every
now and then was requisite in order to air their brains.</p>

<p>They strolled out, accordingly, by twos and threes,
passing over fields glittering with hoar-frost, until they
came to a stile, which having crossed over, they found
themselves immediately in a wood.</p>

<p>It was a fine old place&mdash;that same ancient piece of
woodland, where huge oaks and beeches were interspersed
with the fir, pine and birch. The fantastic
roots that shot out from the gnarled trunks of the
majestic oaks, like giants' limbs writhing in mortal
agony, were coated here and there in broad irregular
patches of dank moss and variously-tinted lichen.
Their distorted colossal branches, stripped of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
leaves and silvered at their extremities with the hoar-frost,
seemed struggling to catch the first beams of a
winter sun, while the shadowy outline of the misty
purple mass of distant trees brought out in bolder relief
and more vigorous hue the foreground thickly strewed
with richly-tinted leaves of russet, scarlet and orange.
The dank fungus, luxuriant in its foul growth, emerged
from the velvet moss as if to outvie in glow the variegated
richness of the dried leaves of the forest.</p>

<p>It was a scene to awaken the soul of a poet, to inspire
a landscape painter with increased love of his art; and as
our two friends McGuilp and Parnassus strolled arm-in-arm
together through this region of enchantment, leaving
their footprints in the crisp frost, which they traversed
with the buoyant footsteps of youth, leaving the elder
members considerably in the rear, each felt himself
drawn towards the other by a bond of common sympathy.
It is not necessary to record every expression of enthusiasm
that escaped the lips of our two friends, nor to
follow minutely the philosophic meditations of the more
mature members of the club who brought up the rear,
as at every step the scene unfolded new and fresh
beauties to their view.</p>

<p>Let it suffice our reader that their morning's walk
proved highly beneficial to them all, for they returned
with marvellous appetites to the inn, where a sumptuous
breakfast of eggs and bacon, coffee, hot rolls, etc., had
just been spread for them by the fair hands of our Helen,
who waited to greet them on the doorstep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>The usual merry bantering from each member of
the club in turn succeeded, as a matter of course, and
was replied to on Helen's part by a pretty rustic coyness
or smart repartee. Our artist thought he had never
seen her look to such advantage as now, glowing in the
full morning light. He noticed, too, that she was more
sprucely dressed than usual. What could it mean? As
he asked himself this question, the church bells of the
village began to chime. The mystery was out&mdash;it was
Sunday, and McGuilp's hopes of a sitting fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>"How say you&mdash;Sunday again?" exclaimed Mr.
Oldstone, as he sat down to his hot coffee. "Dear
me! how the week has passed away!" Then passing
his hand over his chin, he said, "I omitted to shave
this morning. My hand shook so, owing to the stiffness
of my night-cap last night before I went to roost. It
will not do to appear at church with a chin like Hamlet's
'fretful porcupine,' and as I cannot shave myself, I must
inquire if there be not someone skilled in the noble
science of barber-craft in the village. How say you,
Helen, my girl, know you not some knight of the razor,
some nimble and expert mower, who will rid me of this
crop without finding it necessary to combine the art of
the leech at the same time?"</p>

<p>"Aye, sir," answered Helen; "there is young
Master Suds, the village barber, successor to Old Hackchin,
whom folks say never was much account. Young
Suds is lately from France, where he has been improving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
himself in his art. He has introduced into the
village all sorts of new modes for trimming the hair and
wigs, with numerous other French novelties. You would
be sure to be pleased with him, sir."</p>

<p>"Humph!" muttered Mr. Oldstone, who was much
too old-fashioned an English gentleman to be over
partial to our friends across the channel. "I don't want
my head frizzled, thank you, but a firm, steady, English
hand to shave me&mdash;a man that is not above his business,
and who will not bore me to death with his gossip."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, sir," replied Helen, "it is part of a
barber's profession. Many folks think it a recommendation.
I am sure our villagers are delighted with his
store of news."</p>

<p>"No doubt, no doubt," said Oldstone, testily. "He
had better cut it short, though, with me. However,
send for this young blade, and tell him I wish to see a
sample of his art. I shall be ready for him directly
after breakfast."</p>

<p>And off tripped our landlord's pretty daughter in
obedience to the antiquary's orders.</p>

<p>"'Pon my life! Crucible, this bacon is delicious,"
said he, helping himself afresh. "What say you,
Blackdeed?"</p>

<p>Both gentlemen acquiesced, as did also the other
members in turn.</p>

<p>"And the eggs divine," said Dr. Bleedem, bolting
one at a mouthful.</p>

<p>"Excellent," joined in McGuilp and Parnassus,
filling their plates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>The meal passed off pleasantly, and the last member
at table had scarcely wiped his mouth with his napkin
when Master Suds was announced.</p>

<p>"Here, Helen, my dear," said Oldstone, "you may
clear away now, and then you may call in your gallant.
I am sure you will excuse me, gentlemen, for making
you spectators to my operation?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered the club all round.</p>

<p>"There, that will do, Helen; now call him in."</p>

<p>Helen disappeared with the breakfast things, when a
timid knock at the door was heard.</p>

<p>"Come in," roared sundry voices at once, and
Master Suds appeared upon the scene, with his shaving
tackle in a bag, and having his hair frizzled up in a
caricature of the latest French fashion.</p>

<p>"Bong jour, Mounseers," he began, with a flourish.</p>

<p>"Don't mounseer me, you young whipper-snapper,"
said the antiquary; "but learn to speak the king's
English when Englishmen honour you with their custom."</p>

<p>"Pardong, mounseer&mdash;that is, I mean, I beg pardon,
gentlemen; but habit, gentlemen&mdash;habit, you know&mdash;is
rather difficult to get rid of, and when one has just
come from foreign parts, like myself, one is apt to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut it short, young shaver," said Oldstone, "and
bend you to your task. Are your razors sharp?"</p>

<p>"Mais oui, mounseer&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I catch you mounseering me again, I'll make
that French pate of thine and this English fist
acquainted, so mind," said the insulted antiquary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>This terrible threat imposed temporary silence on
our knight of the lather, who soaped and sudded away
for a time without a word.</p>

<p>During this pause the spectators of the operation,
who were seated or standing about the room, conversed
together in groups in an undertone. Mr. Blackdeed
and Mr. Crucible appeared to be particularly engrossed
in conversation, but the tone they spoke in was inaudible
to the ordinary listener. Not so, however, to Mr.
Oldstone, whose ears were unusually sharp, and rendered
more so on the present occasion from the position of
forced quiet that he was obliged to maintain under the
barber's hands. To judge by the tragedian's action, a
looker-on might have supposed him quoting from one of
his own melodramas, and imagined him to say, "Fly
with me, dearest; leave for ever the roof of a tyrant
father, and take shelter in the heart of one who is ready
to lay down his life for thy sake." While Mr. Crucible
might have been supposed to be rehearsing the lady's
part, and to say, "Oh! tempt me not, Alonso; you
know him not. I dare not fly with thee."</p>

<p>The ears of Mr. Oldstone, however, interpreted the
gesticulations in a very different manner. Nothing could
be more plain to the ears of this worthy than these words
from the tragedian. "The political state of France will be
a great interruption to all kinds of business." He could
hardly believe his ears, or that anyone could dare to
use such treasonable words within the sacred precincts
of the club, so he listened again, and this time caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
a few disconnected words in Mr. Crucible's tone of
voice, such as 'stocks,' 'bonds,' 'premiums,' 'interest,'
and the like.</p>

<p>Suddenly the whilom president of the grand
saturnalia of the Wonder Club was observed to start
violently.</p>

<p>"Why, you rascal, you've cut me!" he cried to the
barber.</p>

<p>"Pardong Mounseer, mais ce n'etait pas ma faute,"
said the confused barber.</p>

<p>"What! French again, you monkey, to my face!
Would you add insult to injury?" said the incensed
antiquary.</p>

<p>But calming down at length, said, "Well, well, lad,
I acquit you this time, for I verily believe that those
two gentlemen in the corner there (pointing to Messrs.
Blackdeed and Crucible) are more to blame than
yourself for startling me out of my self-possession by the
tenor of their conversation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Blackdeed, and you too, Mr. Crucible, you are
both perfectly aware that such conversation is not to be
tolerated in the club. I am surprised and grieved to
be obliged to remind two such old members of our
society of their duty, and in order to put a check upon
such lamentable want of discipline, I condemn you Mr.
Blackdeed to recite one of your own tragedies at full
length, and you Mr. Crucible to be ready with a story
when next called upon."</p>

<p>Both of the gentlemen addressed looked abashed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
and muttered something in the shape of an apology.
Having conscientiously discharged his duty, Mr. Oldstone
re-settled himself on his chair, and the operation
proceeded.</p>

<p>Master Suds was the first to endeavour to restore
equanimity.</p>

<p>"A fine day, sir," he said, "for this time of
the year."</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted the antiquary, who was soaped
up to the eyes, and was forced to keep his mouth shut
to avoid having the lather rubbed down his throat.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," continued the barber, "as you say, sir, it
<i>be</i> fine weather sure<i>ly</i>, but it be still finer t'other side of
the channel, <i>&agrave; Paris</i>; that is to say, where I have been
staying for the last six months. Fine city Paris, sir,
very. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, what streets! what shops! What a
treat it be of a morning to rise early and take a
promenade on the Bullyvards!"</p>

<p>"On the what?" inquired his customer.</p>

<p>"On the Bullyvards. Ah! I see, sir, you do not
understand what that means. Well that is the name
the French give to those streets as has trees a running
alongside of 'em. Ah! sir, fine people the French, in
their way&mdash;understand more of barber-craft than they
do in this country. Why, an English barber who has
never been out of his own country is quite an ignoramus
alongside a French barber. But I could teach a trick
or two to some of my countrymen in the line that would
astonish them, having been over there long enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
get into the manners and customs of the natives. But
I say, sir, what a nation they be for quarrelling amongst
themselves, to be sure! There's this here revolution
still going on. What it will all end in goodness only
knows. What do <i>you</i> say, sir?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, and I don't care," replied Mr.
Oldstone, irritably. "They may all go to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A fresh rub of the lather over his mouth prevented
the antiquary from finishing his sentence. The pertinacious
barber was not to be put down.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir," he continued, "I could tell you some
mighty strange tales about that same revolution."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" broke in Mr. Hardcase. "The
members of this club are fond of hearing tales, but
they don't relish much anything connected with politics.
In fact the tales permitted within these walls are almost
entirely of the supernatural order."</p>

<p>"The supernatural!" ejaculated the barber. "Parbleu!
is that still believed in this country? I promise you
our French friends don't believe in that, or anything
else, for aught I know."</p>

<p>"I know they don't, the infidel puppies," growled
the antiquary; "but we do. Do we not, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"Ay, indeed!" answered the members of the club
with one accord.</p>

<p>"Do you indeed, gentlemen!" exclaimed the
astonished barber. "Well, it ain't often that one finds gentlemen of
your standing that will own so much, but as you gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
all declare you believe in such things, I don't mind
telling you that I myself am also a believer."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mr. Oldstone, beginning to be interested.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I am indeed," replied the barber.</p>

<p>"Come, now," said Mr. Crucible, "if you could tell us
of some experience of yours that bordered on the supernatural,
I'd answer for Mr. Oldstone's listening to you."</p>

<p>By this time the antiquary was released from the
clutches of the barber, and Mr. Hardcase, wishing to
profit by the occasion, took his place on the chair, and
a second edition of the lathering began.</p>

<p>"Well," said Oldstone, feeling himself considerably
more comfortable, and throwing himself back complacently
in an easy-chair, "you say&mdash;ahem!&mdash;that you&mdash;you,
at least I have been given to understand that you
have, at some period of your life, had some experience&mdash;ahem!&mdash;of
the supernatural."</p>

<p>"There, I knew he was burning to hear a story,"
cried all the members at once, quizzingly.</p>

<p>"Well, Mounseer Suds, out with it, let's hear."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the barber put on a grave and
important look, and began his story in these words.</p>

<p>Well then, gentlemen, since you deign to encourage
me, I must next trespass on your patience whilst I enter
upon some particulars about my family. I was born in
this village some five-and-twenty years back, and at a
very early age the genius of the barber began to develop
itself in me. My father was a barber before me, and so
was my grandfather and great-grandfather, too, as I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
heard my father say. In fact, from time immemorial
the Suds have been barbers. Descended from a long
line of this honourable profession, and literally reared
in lather, having my youthful imagination fired by the
tales of my father and grandfather of the great people
they had shaved in their day, what wonder that, at a
precocious age, I should yearn to wield the weapon of
my ancestors, and even aspire to be more eminent in the
line than any of my predecessors? It was the height of
my father's ambition&mdash;who was great in his way, and
added to the ordinary routine of business the higher
branches of the art, such as bleeding, tooth drawing,
quack salving, and the like&mdash;that I, his only son, should
step into his shoes, and hand down the name of "Suds"
in all its unblemished purity.</p>

<p>"Joe," he would say to me, "when I am gone to
my long account, who will there be to support your poor
mother unless you fix upon some honest trade for a
livelihood?"</p>

<p>"And what trade should I fix upon, if not yours,
father?" I would reply.</p>

<p>"Well, Joe, my boy," he would say, "if you would
be a true barber, and uphold the honour of the family,
recollect that no excellence is achieved without constant
practice. The primary rules of barber-craft are simple.
Keep your razors sharp and free from rust, your water
boiling; spare not the lather, and rub it well in before
you begin to shave; dip the razor in the boiling water,
and work with a steady hand."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>I promised him that I would abide by his instructions,
and although up to a certain age I was
not permitted to handle a razor, I was, nevertheless,
always in my father's shop, and watched with admiring
eyes the masterly way in which my progenitor finished
off his customers. In the case of a tooth having
to be drawn, or a vein opened, I was never missing,
and great was my pride should my father call
upon me now and then to render him some trifling
assistance. I might have been about seven years old
when I made my first essay.</p>

<p>It was about Christmas time, and my father had
just killed a pig, which he had left hung up by the legs
in the yard. Being left alone for a few minutes, a bright
idea struck me. I would try my "'prentice han'" on the
carcase of the porker. So, locking all the doors so as
not to be interrupted, I mixed up a lather and, with one
of my father's well-sharpened razors, I commenced operations.
Whilst thus busily employed, I was attracted by
the sound of smothered laughter, and looking up at the
window of our next-door neighbour's house, which looked
into our yard, I beheld some dozen of the neighbours,
who had been called in to witness my performance. I
thought they would have died with laughter. However,
nothing daunted, I proceeded diligently with my task,
until my father, rattling at the door, demanded instant
admittance. I was forced to admit him, and when he
saw what I had been about, he quickly snatched the
razor from my hand, and calling me "a dirty young dog,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
administered to me a slight kick behind, although I
thought at the time, by the expression on his face, and
likewise by that on my mother's, that my parents felt
inwardly proud of their son.</p>

<p>An interval of two years now elapsed before I again
put hand to razor. I remember that at this time I was
nine years old, and it was when I was at this tender age
that my poor father caught a fever and died.</p>

<p>As you may suppose, gentlemen, it was a terrible
blow to my poor widowed mother, who, besides the
grief she naturally felt for the loss of an affectionate
husband, found herself now alone in the world with a
growing lad to support as well as herself by the scanty
proceeds of the business.</p>

<p>It was some little time before I could realise
the fact that my father was actually dead. When my
mother first brought me the startling news I heard it in
a sort of stupor, resembling insensibility, out of which I
did not awake until the undertaker arrived with the
coffin, when the whole extent of our calamity seemed to
dawn upon me for the first time, and I fairly howled for
grief. Whilst thus indulging my sorrow, a few neighbours
dropped in to see my father laid out in his coffin
before he was nailed down. I heard my mother make
something like an apology for showing her husband's
body before it had been shaved. I stopped short in my
sobbing and mused awhile. It was then the custom to
shave a corpse before consigning it to its last home.
Who was to perform this duty?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>Here the instinct of the barber came over me.
Not a moment was to be lost if I really intended to put
my plan into practice. Yes, I myself would shave my
father's corpse, and no other. Accordingly, as my
mother was showing out the neighbours and listening to
their well meant condolences on the threshold, I quickly
locked myself into the room with the corpse, having
previously procured the apparatus necessary for the
operation. I bore in my mind my father's instructions,
"Keep your razor sharp, and free from rust; let the
water be boiling, and don't spare the lather, but rub it
well in before you begin." I now proceeded to put my
father's advice into practice; so, lathering well the face
of the corpse, and rubbing the suds well in, I proceeded
to wield the razor with a dexterity at first that surprised
me with my own performance and encouraged me to
attempt something of that "nonchalance" of style that
I had observed my father adopt whilst shaving his customers,
but which is not looked upon as quite safe until
one has undergone considerable practice.</p>

<p>Now, this was only my second attempt; still, I
was so elated at having gone through the shaving of
both cheeks as well as the throat, without a single cut,
that I already deemed myself a proficient in the art,
and affected that air of ease and careless grace I have
just alluded to whilst I attempted the scraping of the
upper lip, when, oh, horror! the razor gave an untimely
slip, and sliced my father's nose off! I dropped the
razor in my fright, and I really wonder I did not go off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
in a fit on the spot, such was the thrill of terror that
seized me as I gazed on the ghastly hideousness of my
father's corpse as it lay noseless in its coffin. I staggered
and almost fell to the ground, but mustering all my
courage, I picked up the nose and clapped it on in its
place. I remember that in my eagerness and hurry I
stuck it on the wrong way, with the nostrils upwards,
which gave an appearance at once fearful and ludicrous
to its ghastly features. It rolled off, however, immediately,
and I hastened to rectify my mistake, and after
much care and adroitness, succeeded in poising the
feature nicely in the centre of the face, in the hopes
that it would adhere of its own accord to the spot, and
proceeded with the operation; but, alas, no sooner had I
begun to meddle with the upper lip, than off rolled the
nose again, so I just let it be this time until I had
completed the operation.</p>

<p>Having, with the exception of this trifling accident,
shaved the corpse of my father to a nicety, I wiped off
the lather, replaced the nose, and quitted the room,
carrying back my shaving tackle to the shop.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards my mother entered the room,
and was surprised at finding the corpse already shaved.
She had intended shaving it herself. I was silent on
the subject, and she inquired no further into the matter,
being too absorbed with her grief.</p>

<p>Presently the undertaker returned to nail up the
coffin, and my mother hastened to give my father one
last parting kiss before he was nailed up for ever. Suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
I heard a shriek, and rushing into the room, found my
mother in hysterics. The cause was obvious. In
approaching her lips to those of her defunct spouse, the
nose had unexpectedly rolled off, causing a shock similar
to that I experienced myself when I so unskilfully
amputated my father's nasal protuberance. When my
mother came to, I made a clean breast of my awkwardness,
for which I received a severe scolding, accompanied
by sundry boxes on the ear. At length the coffin was
nailed up, and I followed it with my mother to the
grave, but for nights afterwards, my noseless father
haunted me in my dreams, carrying a basin of suds in
one hand, and holding his nose between finger and
thumb with the other, as if to reproach me with my
awkwardness.</p>

<p>When I related these dreams to my mother, she
became uneasy in her mind, and declared that all
through my awkwardness my father was unable to find
rest in the tomb. She was a great believer in dreams,
visions, omens, prophecies, and the like, and said that
the dream boded no good. Being a mere child then,
I became infected with her fears, though as I grew up
I began to reason with myself that a dream of that sort
might very well be accounted for by the excited state of
my brain at the time and tendency of my waking
thoughts, without jumping at once at the conclusion
that there was anything supernatural in it.</p>

<p>For some time after my father's death I used to
pester my mother with many of those questions that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
children are so fond of asking, and mothers find so
difficult to answer&mdash;viz., concerning Heaven, and a
future state after death. She used to tell me that
Heaven was a place for all good people, far, far away,
high up above the stars, where good folks lived on for
ever, and never grew old, and never to die any more;
that they were very happy, and knew no more pain or
sorrow, but became as the angels, and had wings and
sang praises to God all day long on a cloud. Moreover,
that it was very light and bright there, that all was
endless sunshine, and the angels were dressed in
shining garments, etc.</p>

<p>Still, I was anxious to know more about Heaven;
how long it took to get there&mdash;being so far off; whether
father wouldn't get tired flying all that distance, and if
so, where he would stop to rest on the road; what sort of
amusements there were in Heaven, and finally whether
there was any shaving there. This last question was a
puzzler. I was not to be put off by mother telling me
that angels didn't require shaving, for then I argued
that if father had gone to Heaven, he would be out of
employment, and consequently miserable and not happy,
for I knew what pleasure my father took in his business.
Now if my father could not be happy without employment,
the only employment he cared about being shaving,
and if in Heaven that employment were not permitted
or encouraged, it followed that my father could not be
in Heaven, for who ever heard of a soul in Heaven and
not happy?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>My next question was whether there were any
shaving in the other place. This was equally difficult to
answer, for if my mother should admit that there was,
then I should have argued that my father must be there,
which would not have been a consoling idea, and if not,
where should he be, since he could not be in either of
these places? My mother was fain to confess that she
did not know much about it, but said she would ask the
minister. Whether she did or not, I never ascertained.
I began to reflect for myself. The apostles were good
men, as I had been given to understand, and good men
always went to Heaven. Yet from their effigies upon
the old stained-glass windows of the village church, they
were all represented with long beards. Therefore
barber-craft could not be encouraged in Heaven.
Nothing could be more conclusive than this. My
doubts were at rest for ever, but I felt less happy than
before I began to argue on these matters.</p>

<p>Ever since my father's death the whole weight of
the business fell upon my mother. Even in my father's
lifetime she had so profited by his lessons as to be able
to lend a helping hand occasionally when the customers
were numerous and was thought to possess no inconsiderable
skill in the art, but now that my father was no
more, she had to put her shoulder to the wheel for her
very bread. As for myself, it was long before our
villagers could be induced to place any confidence in my
shaving, the report of my father's unlucky amputation
having spread like wildfire through the neighbourhood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>At length a strange gentleman passed through the
village, and calling at our shop, demanded to be shaved.
My mother not being in at the time, I offered my
services, which were accepted, and acquitted myself to
the entire satisfaction of my customer. The gentleman
chancing to mention to someone that he had been
shaved by a mere boy, and better than he had ever been
shaved in his life, my fame began to spread in the
village, and from that day we were in no want of
customers.</p>

<p>Business went on swimmingly until I was twelve
years old, when I had the misfortune to lose my poor
mother. I was now quite alone in the world, so in
order to instruct myself more fully in the higher
branches of the art, such as wig making, hair-cutting,
etc., I offered myself as apprentice under the late Mr.
Hackchin, under whose tuition in the wig line I vastly
improved, although even from the beginning my
shaving was universally preferred to his. Lor, sirs! his
razors were never sharp, his water always lukewarm,
and his hand shook as with the palsy. The fact was,
he was getting old, was my poor employer, and ought,
in my opinion, to have given up business long before he
did, when he might have retired from the field with all
due honours, and handed down his name unstained to
posterity.</p>

<p>Well, gentlemen, not to wear out your patience, I
will at once proceed to the very heart of my story&mdash;plunge
into the very thick of the lather, as my poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
father used to say&mdash;being about the time of my going
abroad, and the reason of it. It was now some time
since I had begun to cast sheep's eyes on the pretty
Sally Snip, daughter of Simon Snip, the village tailor.
We met by stealth, took long walks together of a Sunday
in the green lane, danced together on the green on
holidays, exchanged tokens, breathed vows of eternal
fidelity, and all the rest of it. Our interviews were
detected at length by Sally's parents, who looked on our
attachment with no favourable eyes. Old Snip was
ambitious, and designed quite another match for his
daughter than a penniless young barber like myself,
and gave me plainly to understand that if I did not
<i>sheer</i> off he would <i>baste</i> my broadcloth for me. I was
in a rage, but smothered it for prudence sake, yet didn't
I wish in that moment that I had the shaving of him&mdash;wouldn't
I have scraped him, that's all! Well, words
grew high; I protested that my intentions were strictly
honourable, etc., etc., but all to no purpose; the
obstinate old parent wouldn't see what was for his
daughter's good, and I left him very much disgusted.
A few stolen interviews were attempted after this, but
were all frustrated, and I soon saw we were not destined
for one another, so we met for the last time, wept,
embraced, and vowed still to love each other to
eternity.</p>

<p>Now, there is no knowing but I might still have
sought to renew my interviews, had not an extraordinary
circumstance occurred to alter my determination. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
the very night after our parting I was tossing restlessly
on my bed, between sleeping and waking, when all of a
sudden&mdash;whether it was a dream, I know not, but I
fancy that I was awake&mdash;all at once there stood by my
bedside the spirit of my father in the habiliments of the
grave, unblemished in whiteness as the suds he used in
his lifetime, and, approaching me solemnly, said,</p>

<p>"My son, all that has happened is for the best.
Stick to thy trade, and rival the most illustrious of thy
ancestors, to which end thou must visit Paris. I will
guide thy steps. Practise incessantly. We shall meet
again."</p>

<p>With these words the vision vanished, and I felt
myself bathed in a cold sweat.</p>

<p>I slept no more that night, but rose early the following
morning. My determination was fixed, for a
parent's command from the other side of the tomb was
not to be combated, so I scraped together my slender
earnings, tied up my bundle, took leave of my employer,
and paid my passage over to Paris.</p>

<p>Soon after my departure Sally Snip became the
wife of Daniel Nimble, an aspiring apprentice of old
Simon's. This was my first love, and, like most first
loves, ended miserably. Few men there are I wot who
can boast of having loved but once, and of having lived
uncrossed in that love to the end of the chapter. But
I digress.</p>

<p>No sooner arrived in Paris than I began searching
out the names and addresses of the most celebrated men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
in the hair line of the day with a view of offering my
services as assistant. The day after my arrival I passed
a large and handsome shop, evidently a first-rate business,
with a large printed card in the window. Now,
although at that time I had not the remotest knowledge of
the French language, and consequently could not
possibly understand what was written on the card, yet
an indescribable I-don't-know-what, an inexplicable
"<i>je-ne-sais-quoi</i>" (perchance a spiritual dig in the ribs
from my father), induced me to interpret the words,
"<i>A boy wanted</i>." I was as certain as I am of my own
existence that the proprietor was in want of an assistant
and that my services would be accepted, so I entered
the shop, addressed the proprietor in English, which, it
is needless to say, was perfectly unintelligible to him.
However, by expressive signs, I told him I was an adept,
and that he couldn't do better than engage me. He
smiled, the bargain was struck, and from that day I
commenced my career in a foreign land.</p>

<p>My employer was one Pierre le Chauve, a hair-dresser
who had an extensive business in the Rue St. Honor&egrave;,
and who was especially renowned for the neatness and
elegance of his wigs. He also cut hair, manufactured
fancy soaps, hair oil, hair dye, perfumery, and the like.
He had one daughter, Mademoiselle Pauline, of some
eighteen summers, as neat a little grisette as ever trod
the Champs Elys&eacute;es or the Bois de Boulogne on
Sundays, and who presided at the counter and sold
articles of perfumery to the Parisian exquisites, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
whom she chatted with the most charming ease and
grace and bewitching na&iuml;vet&eacute;.</p>

<p>Pauline was the thorough type of a French girl.
Eyes of dark hazel, set wide apart in her head, nez
retrousee, rather wide mouth and exceptional teeth, small
hand and foot, jimp waist, and a countenance capable
of every possible shade of expression, while her voice,
by nature pitched in a high key, rose to shrillest treble
when under any excitement.</p>

<p>Besides myself, there was another assistant, one
Jacques Millefleurs, a conceited French puppy, who
fancied himself irresistible, and used to persecute his
employer's daughter with the most marked attentions
whenever her father's back was turned, and which she,
it must be confessed, did not appear to be entirely
indifferent to, although, at the same time, she gave him
plainly to understand that she intended to flirt with
whomever she liked without asking <i>his</i> permission, and
that he had no right whatever to monopolise her.
Jacques was of an exceedingly jealous temper, and could
ill brook this tone from the object of his affections; this
she knew well, and often took a malicious delight in
provoking him by putting on her best airs and graces
and being doubly fascinating whenever a handsome customer
came to the shop. It was then that Jacques
would grow pale, and dart vicious side glances from the
corners of his eyes; but Pauline took no notice of him
whatever, but flirted more and more, as if to aggravate
him. After the customer had departed they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
have a lovers' quarrel, and then they would make it up
again, and so on from day to day.</p>

<p>Now, all this could be of very little interest to me,
even if I had understood their conversation, for had I
not my own secret grief? Was it to be supposed that I
could forget Sally in a day? No; whilst I in silence
counted and separated the hairs destined to be woven
into the scalp of a wig, or whilst shaving a customer or
cutting his hair, my soul was in the green lane with
Sally, or behind her at church, or under her window at
night, watching for a momentary glimpse of her shadow
on the window blind. In fact, whatever happened to
be my employment, Sally was ever uppermost in my
thoughts, and still continued to be so, even some time
after the sad news reached me that she had married
Daniel Nimble. This shock at first was terrific, but,
gradually subsiding, I resolved at length that, as she had
so soon forgotten me, not to think of her any more,
which in time I succeeded in doing. From being
moody and silent, I now became more talkative, for I
had begun to pick up a few phrases in French.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Pauline encouraged me in my progress,
and was pleased to take a great interest in me,
much to the disgust of her admirer, Jacques Millefleurs,
who began to look upon me as a probable rival. I
daily improved in the French language under my fair
tutor, and day by day she gained upon me, for she
certainly had the most winning manners. The more I
talked with her, the less I thought of Sally, till at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
she succeeded in completely supplanting her in my
heart, and I found myself, before I was well aware of it,
head over ears in love with the fascinating grisette.</p>

<p>Here was a to do. Murder will out. Love and a
cough are two things one can't hide, as the proverb
says.</p>

<p>The odious Jacques <i>must</i> discover my passion
ere long, and a quarrel will be inevitable. Not that I
feared the likes of him, gentlemen. Don't suppose it
for a moment. Why, I'd take half a dozen or so of
such fellows one off and another on, and thrash the
whole lot of them as easy as a game of ninepins. Well,
but to proceed, gentlemen. What I foresaw soon happened.
One day while taking my French lesson under
Mademoiselle Pauline, and we were chatting away
merrily enough without taking any notice of Jacques,
who was arranging pots of bears' grease on the shelves
in the background, our heads drew very close together,
and we were looking very fondly into each other's eyes
and whispering rather low.</p>

<p>Now, I knew that there was no engagement between
her and Jacques, therefore I had every right to pay her
just the same attention that he did, and I intended to
let him know it. Well, my head might have touched
hers, or my locks may have intermingled with hers as
we pored over the French grammar together. However
this may have been, something or other seems to have
exasperated my rival, for I heard him mutter to himself
something like <i>Cochon d'un Anglais</i>. I was getting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
in my French now and understood the words, so turning
round, I said,</p>

<p>"Did your remark refer to me, Monsieur Jacques?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui &agrave; vous</i>," he said, furiously, now losing all command
over himself, and heedless of the consequences;
"and I repeat my remark."</p>

<p>Here he repeated his obnoxious epithet with an
invective against my countrymen in general.</p>

<p>"Hold there!" I cried, for I began to feel my
English blood boil in my veins, and in the best French
I could muster, said,</p>

<p>"Retract your words. I give you one chance to
apologise, and if you refuse&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before I could finish my rival's legs had formed a
right angle, and I received a <i>sav&acirc;t</i> in the eye. Stung
by the pain, and still more by the insult, I felt the
strength of our whole line of barbers rush into my
veins, and clenching my fist convulsively I let forth so
terrible a blow in the chest of my adversary as to make
him measure his length upon the floor, and cause the
back of his head to resound against it like a cocoanut.
Miss Pauline screamed, but the next moment my rival
had bounced upright upon his feet, and seized a razor.
Another scream from Pauline as he was making towards
me, razor in hand, but this time I took up a chair and
with it gave him such a blow over the knuckles as made
him drop the razor and yell in agony. I laid down the
chair, thinking that the fight was now over, but the
Frenchman sprang on to me again like a hungry tiger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
and so unexpected was the movement that I nearly
lost my balance, but with great adroitness I managed to
trip him up, and he fell under me.</p>

<p>He now began to bite and to scratch, but I seized
his hair and banged his head against the ground several
times. He then clutched me anew, and we began
rolling over and over on the floor, Pauline screaming all
the while, but extricating myself at length from his
grasp, I bounded to my feet, and before he had time to
rise placed one foot upon his throat. At this moment
my employer attracted by his daughter's screams,
entered.</p>

<p>"<i>Mille diables!</i>" he cried, fiercely, "<i>ques-ce-que ce
tappage la? Ah! &ccedil;a, Monsieur Godam</i>," said he, turning
full upon me, "<i>esce que vous &ecirc;tes entr&eacute; chez moi pour
ensegner le box &agrave; mes el&eacute;ves?</i>"</p>

<p>Here Pauline broke in.</p>

<p>"No, I assure you, dear papa, it was not the
Englishman's fault. Millefleurs began the quarrel. I
saw him kick the Englishman in the eye."</p>

<p>"Ha! Monsieur Jacques, you did kick the Englishman
in the eye?" inquired my employer; "and what
for did you kick the Englishman in the eye?"</p>

<p>"Because he used undue familiarity towards Mademoiselle,"
said Jacques, doggedly.</p>

<p>Le Chauve glanced suspiciously first at me then at
his daughter, but Pauline, stung at Jacques' mean
attempt at exposing me as well as herself to her father's
obloquy, rose in all the pride of injured womanhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
as if to take the whole burden of defence upon herself,
and standing erect with compressed lips and white with
passion, cried,</p>

<p>"It is false, 'tis a base lie! The Englishman never
treated me otherwise than with the greatest respect,
nor have I ever received at his hands any of those
attentions that in my indulgence I have permitted
from yourself. Think not, however, Master Jacques,
that this calumny will serve your turn, or that I am
blind to the paltry motives that prompted it. Your
absurd jealousy is seen through, and has met with its
just chastisement. What was it to you, I pray, even if
the Englishman <i>had</i> paid me attention? Must you be
the only one to pay me attention? You know very
well that I have never granted you any right to monopolise
me, however your conceit may have deluded you.
Beware, therefore, in future how you attempt to calumniate
either myself or this Englishman, for as sure as
you are born you will not succeed in your scheme, and
know, once for all, Monsieur Jacques Millefleurs, that
for the future I wish all those attentions that you have
been pleased to lavish upon me so profusely whenever
my father's back was turned, to cease. Respect me as
your employer's daughter, for I vow never to be anything
more to you."</p>

<p>She ceased; but during her harangue, Pauline's
deportment was majestic&mdash;it was sublime. No longer
was she the little grisette with the cock-nose and the
wide mouth, but a tragedy queen pronouncing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
malediction. She appeared now at least half a head taller,
so imposing was her attitude. The roses and smile had
deserted her countenance, and were supplanted by a
ghastly pallor, while from her dark eyes flashed a withering
scorn, under which Jacques appeared to quail like a
whipped hound, but which feeling his natural pride
sought to overcome.</p>

<p>Rage, grief, jealousy, and confusion struggled in his
breast for the mastery, as he stood speechless, with
clenched fists, teeth set, flushed face, and straining eyeballs
fixed upon the ground, to which the tears would
start spite of all his efforts to repress them. His hair
disordered and dirty, as well as his clothes, from his fall,
he looked altogether the very picture of maniacal despair.</p>

<p>"Ha! Jacques," said his employer, "is this true?
What! have you dared to raise your eyes to my daughter,
and that, too, behind my back, without my permission&mdash;<i>hein</i>?"</p>

<p>Jacques, overcome with shame and speechless, never
lifted his eyes from the ground, whilst the large tears,
blinding him and overflowing, fell heavily on the floor.</p>

<p>"<i>Prenez garde, Monsieur Jacques</i>," said Le Chauve,
"for, <i>parbleu!</i> if I hear any more of these clandestine
overtures with my daughter I'll discharge you on the
spot. And you, too, Ma'meselle Pauline, you, too, were
much to blame in not telling me at once of this boy's
insolent pretensions. But, tell me once more, who
began this ridiculous quarrel? Who gave the first
blow?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please, sir," said I, now speaking for the first time,
"I was taking my French lesson with your daughter,
when Monsieur Jacques was pleased to call me '<i>cochon</i>,'
and abused my country. I demanded an apology,
which he refused, and before I was aware of it, kicked
me in the eye. I gave one straight blow with my fist,
<i>comme &ccedil;a</i>"&mdash;(here I imitated the blow to show him
how an Englishman could knock a Frenchman down)&mdash;"and
he fell full length upon the floor."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is true, papa," broke in Pauline; "the
Englishman has spoken the truth."</p>

<p>"<i>C'etait bien fait, c'etait bien fait</i>," said her father;
"go on."</p>

<p>"Then," resumed I, "Millefleurs sprang again to
his feet, and seized a razor."</p>

<p>"Ha! he seized a razor? Is that so, Monsieur
Millefleurs? Did you seize a razor?"</p>

<p>Jacques was silent as before, while I proceeded, "I
then seized a chair."</p>

<p>"You seized a chair, <i>h&eacute;bien</i>!"</p>

<p>"And I knocked the razor out of his hand. He fell
to the ground with pain, and yelled."</p>

<p>"<i>Encore, bien fait&mdash;apr&egrave;s?</i>"</p>

<p>"He jumped up again, and pounced upon me like a
tiger, and nearly knocked me over, but I tripped him up
in time, and he fell to the ground, together with myself,
and then we rolled over and over each other on the
floor, till I at length succeeded in extricating myself, and
placed my foot upon his neck, when you entered, sir."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>C'est bien vraie</i>," burst in Pauline again; "the
Englishman has given an exact account of the quarrel."</p>

<p>"Ha! is that so?" asked Le Chauve. "<i>H&eacute;bien!</i>
Monsieur Jacques, you have refused to apologise to the
Englishman for insulting him and kicking him in the
eye. Now, I command you to apologise to him, or out
of my shop you shall go at once. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Non; <i>mille fois non</i>!" cried Jacques, stamping
with rage, forgetful alike of the respect due to his
master and the presence of Pauline, "I would sooner
die first."</p>

<p>"Then prepare at once to leave my house. Take
up your bundle and walk!"</p>

<p>The peremptory manner in which these words were
said caused Jacques to pause and weigh matters.</p>

<p>"If my employer actually does send me off," he
probably said to himself, "then adieu to Pauline for
ever, but if I consent to apologise, I shall remain
here, and may in time succeed in cutting out the
Englishman."</p>

<p>This was probably his mode of reasoning, for he
was too good a politician not to know where his interests
lay, so changing his tone entirely, and gulping down
with difficulty something that was rising in his throat,
and which, if he had given expression to, would
probably have resembled an ingenious French oath, he
replied with great apparent calmness,</p>

<p>"Monsieur Le Chauve, you have always been a
good master to me, and I have always tried to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
myself worthy of your kindness, and I should be sorry
to leave you for a trifle, therefore I will obey you, and
will demand pardon of <i>mon cher confrere l'anglais</i>, for
having in a moment of ungovernable passion kicked
him in the eye, and insulted him."</p>

<p>This was said in turning towards me, and in all
humility.</p>

<p>"And you, Monsieur Suds, if you forgive him, offer
him your hand."</p>

<p>I extended my hand towards my fellow assistant,
which he took in his, and I expressed sorrow for the
part I had had in the quarrel, but I noticed that the
hand of Jacques Millefleurs was icy cold.</p>

<p>"<i>Allons mes enfants</i>," said Le Chauve, "now don't let
me hear any more of these silly quarrels, but go in peace."</p>

<p>We both set about our respective duties, but I
knew enough of the Frenchman's character to be sure
that his apology did not come from his heart, but
had been forced out of him from motives of policy,
and I was not at all sure that this would be the last of
such quarrels, but had no doubt that he would vent his
petty spite upon me on the very next opportunity.</p>

<p>I had hardly re-settled myself, and proceeded
with my wig, when a stranger of dignified appearance
entered and demanded to be shaved. I had no
difficulty in recognising in him a countryman. Glad of
an opportunity of speaking English again after so long,
I answered him in his own mother tongue.</p>

<p>"Want to be shaved, sir? Yes, sir."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, you are English!" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, one of the latest imported," said I.
"Only arrived here a month ago to perfect myself in
the art of barber-craft amongst these foreigners. Served
under Mr. Hackchin in the village of D&mdash;&mdash;, in &mdash;&mdash;shire,
where I have learnt to shave, cut hair, make
wigs, mix hair grease, and all the rest of it, and as for
tooth drawing, bleeding, and quack salving, you won't
find the likes of me in all the countryside. My name is
Suds, sir, at your service. Maybe you have heard tell
of my father or my grandfather. The Suds have been
barbers from time immemorial."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed?" said the stranger. Then muttered
to himself, "Suds&mdash;Suds&mdash;I fancy I have heard the
name before."</p>

<p>And I should just think he had, gentlemen. Why,
my grandfather once shaved His Majesty King George
I., or George II., or Queen Anne, or one of that lot, I
forget which, as my father used to tell me.</p>

<p>Well, gentlemen, when I had got my countryman
fairly lathered, and had commenced operations, I
noticed that he glanced half-quizzingly at my eye,
which was now black and swollen from the kick I had
received from my adversary.</p>

<p>"You seem to have a bad cold in your eye, Mr.
Suds," he remarked, with an ill-repressed smile.</p>

<p>"No, sir," I replied, "it is not exactly that."</p>

<p>"Not a cold!" exclaimed he, feigning astonishment.
"Dear me! it's very like one. Then if I might venture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
to guess, I should say you had been in a fight, and got
the worst of it."</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly, sir," said I; "not the worst of it;
no, not the worst of it. It is true I had a slight difference
of opinion this morning with a young man of the shop,
a mere trifle&mdash;an affair of jealousy, that's all, sir."</p>

<p>"And I presume that that neat little baggage in the
corner of the shop with the jimp waist and well starched
cap was the fair cause of this trifling jealousy&mdash;am I right?"</p>

<p>"Well, really, sir, your penetration is such that it
serves not to deny it," said I. "If you had only arrived
five minutes earlier, you would have caught me at it
tooth and nail. Oh! it <i>was</i> fine, sir. He caught me a
kick in the eye unawares&mdash;French fashion you know,
sir. Englishmen don't like that sort of game, it takes
them by surprise; but you should have seen how I
floored him with a good English blow in the chest that
made him measure his length upon the ground. You
should have heard what a whack his head came against
the floor. It sounded for all the world like an empty
cask. It will ache for him this next fortnight to come,
I'll warrant."</p>

<p>"Oh! then England <i>wasn't</i> thrashed after all?"
said he.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said I, proudly.</p>

<p>"Well, you seem a smart lad," said he. "I don't
mind giving you a job to do every morning during my
stay in Paris. Suppose you come every morning to
my hotel to shave me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>"With pleasure, sir," said I.</p>

<p>"Here is my address," said he, handing me a card.</p>

<p>I read the name Lord Goldborough, Hotel &mdash;&mdash;,
Rue &mdash;&mdash;, No. 25 <i>au premier</i>. I fell into a sort of
stupor at the discovery that I had been shaving a real
live lord, without knowing it. So taken aback was I,
that I forgot to stuff his pockets with bears' grease,
tooth powder, fancy soaps, hair dye, tooth and nail
brushes, etc.</p>

<p>Before I had well recovered, he was out of the shop.
He had left an English paper behind him by mistake,
and a letter, the former of which I perused, while the
latter I placed in my pocket, to return to him on the
morrow at his hotel.</p>

<p>No sooner had my countryman left the shop than
Pauline asked me if he wasn't an Englishman.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, glad of an opportunity of making
myself big in her eyes and of inspiring my rival with
awe and respect for me; "his name is Lord Goldborough,
<i>un grand milord</i>, who has known me many years, and
all my family. In fact," said I, "he is distantly connected
with us."&mdash;(I did not say on account of our both
being descended from Adam).</p>

<p>I told them in the shop that he had engaged
my services every morning at his hotel to shave
him, for old acquaintance sake, and finally that he
had called on me on purpose, under the excuse
of being shaved, to lend me that paper to read,
where there was a long account of the great political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
deeds of a celebrated English minister related to us
both; in fact, no less a man than the renowned William
Pitt. There's no harm in making yourself as big as
you can when you are sure of not being found out&mdash;eh,
gentlemen?&mdash;and when you do come out with a lie, tell
a good 'un whilst you're about it&mdash;that's my morality.</p>

<p>Pauline raised her eyebrows and looked at me archly,
half incredulously. Jacques, who had been sulkily
combing out some bunches of hair for wig-making
behind the counter, looked up for a moment, his mouth
wide open with astonishment, then resumed his work.</p>

<p>I little knew at the time how dearly I should have to
pay for a few idle words. These are dangerous times to
jest in, gentlemen, especially t'other side of the water,
and if you happen to have an enemy. I was inexperienced
in these matters then, but I have bought my
experience since, and dearly enough I had to pay for it.</p>

<p>On the following morning I hastened to keep my
appointment with my noble countryman. I found him
very affable and condescending, and he was pleased to
compliment me on my skill in barber-craft. He talked
to me much about England and my family, of politics,
of the French, etc., and asked me how I liked foreign
parts. I naturally felt flattered at the interest he seemed
to take in me, but I knew how to keep my place, always
styling him "my lord" and "your lordship." In fact,
we got on capitally together. When I returned to the
shop I bragged of the intimacy between my patron and
myself, not always sticking literally to the truth, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
colouring my reception a little highly to excite envy and
respect in my rival and interest in Pauline.</p>

<p>After this I went regularly every day to his lordship,
and came back after every visit with an extravagantly
coloured account of my noble customer's bounty and
friendship for me, as well as the unlimited share of his
confidence that I enjoyed. Pauline's smiles grew daily
more winning, and Jacques scowled more and more
savagely from behind the counter.</p>

<p>One morning, as I was preparing as usual to start for
my noble patron's hotel, an ugly-looking ruffian, dressed
in the preposterous fashion of the "incroyables," entered
the shop, and strutting up to my employer, who was
hard at work on a new wig, said, "Citoyen, you harbour
a '<i>suspect</i>.'"</p>

<p>"Not I, my friend, I assure you," said Le Chauve.
"It is a mistake; I have no one in the house but my
wife and daughter and two apprentices&mdash;one an Englishman
lately arrived."</p>

<p>"Just so, an Englishman, a spy of the English
Government; a most dangerous character, and on the
most intimate terms with Lord Goldboro', who is himself
a spy."</p>

<p>"It cannot possibly be my assistant Suds," muttered
my employer to himself.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, Suds, c'est bien lui, le voici</i>," and he showed
a warrant for my immediate arrest.</p>

<p>"<i>Mais c'est impossible, monch&eacute;re, ce pauvre gar&ccedil;on,
si jeune, si innocent</i>," pleaded my kind employer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I have my orders. If he is innocent,
he will be proved so. I come not to dispute whether he
be innocent or guilty, but to arrest him," said the incroyable.
"<i>Allons, o&ugrave; est-il?</i>"</p>

<p>Now, concealment I knew to be impossible, resistance
futile. The only thing to be done was to face the
matter out boldly and trust to Providence. (Of course,
I made no doubt as to whom I had to thank for my
arrest.) So walking bravely into the shop, without any
show of fear, I thus accosted the incroyable, "So,
citoyen, it appears you have orders to arrest me. I will
not dispute your authority, although I know myself to
be innocent of the charges brought against me. I can
pretty well guess <i>which</i> of my kind friends has been so
considerate as to procure for me a safe night's lodging
free from expense, and his motive in doing so."</p>

<p>Here I darted a withering glance at Jacques, who
cowered beneath my gaze, and another pleading one at
Pauline, as if I would say, "You see how I am betrayed,
and by whom."</p>

<p>Pauline stood pale as death&mdash;or rather, leant against
the wall for support. She seemed unable to utter
a word, and yet seemed struggling with herself
to defend me. As if spell-bound, she looked on in mute
horror, until the guard entered the shop, and I had barely
time to say, "<i>Au revoir, Monsieur le Chauve; adieu,
Mademoiselle Pauline.</i> I am innocent, whatever my
enemies may try and make me out, and doubt not but
I shall be able to prove my innocence. Await my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
speedy return. <i>En evant, gards</i>," and off I was conducted
by the soldiers.</p>

<p>I was hardly out of the shop when a piercing female
shriek reached my ears, and poor Pauline had fallen
fainting to the ground. I saw and heard no more, for
though I was outwardly calm, my brain was racked with
the direst apprehensions.</p>

<p>Here I was being led openly through the streets of
Paris like a felon&mdash;whither? To prison&mdash;to the Bastille,
to be tried; possibly, nay probably, to be condemned to
death. What for? What had I done? "Nothing; I
am innocent," I said to myself. "No matter, so have
others been that have likewise perished by the guillotine,"
I thought I heard a voice inwardly say. "Executions
are now of daily occurrence, and not individuals, but
hundreds of individuals, perish for they know not what.
Marat, from out his obscure lodgings, and seated up to
the neck in his warm bath, doth complacently issue forth
his bloody orders, from which not even innocence itself
is free. Oh, the malignity of human nature!" thought
I. "Base, base Jacques Millefleurs! for who else could
have betrayed me? And Pauline, poor girl! what would
become her?"</p>

<p>Then came another thought forcing its way through
my brain, despite my efforts to crush it. Pauline for
the present, it is true, was disgusted with Millefleurs,
especially for this last dastardly act of his, but women
are proverbially fickle&mdash;the whole French nation is
volatile&mdash;and after my death, and she had shed a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
transient tears belike to my memory, Jacques <i>might</i>
work himself into her good graces again, and even
<i>marry</i> her&mdash;the thought was agony. The mere fear of
death itself was perhaps the last thought that occupied
me, for I felt I had no parents to regret me; on the
contrary, I felt consoled in the thought that I should see
them again in the other world. No; it was not mere
death that I feared so much; but then, to leave Pauline,
to be cut short in my brilliant career, before I had established
my fame!</p>

<p>These were thoughts that galled me. Nevertheless,
I tried to console myself. Perhaps things might not be
so black as my imagination had painted them, and even
if they should be&mdash;even if I should die by the guillotine
for an imagined State offence&mdash;it was not like being
gibbeted alive in my own country for a highway robbery
or murder. No; there was something aristocratic in the
idea of being guillotined, for did not the scaffold reek
with noble blood?</p>

<p>Amid such reflections as these I was conducted by
the guard to the gates of the Bastille, and before I was
well aware of it, found myself in a spacious cell, and
heard the lock turned upon me. Here a singular and
never-to-be-forgotten scene was presented to my view.
The prison was crowded with men and women of all
ranks and ages, many of whom were to die on the
morrow, yet most of them appeared to have no fear of
death whatever. Here and there were knots of friends
who seemed determined to make the most of their short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
stay in this world, and to enjoy life to the utmost.
Here was dicing and card playing, laughing, joking, and
swearing, as if they thought it prime fun to die in
company. Surely these men, thought I, must be
accustomed to death, as they say eels are to skinning,
that they no longer mind it.</p>

<p>There were, however, prisoners of another cast,
persons who preferred spending their last moments on
earth in prayer and pious meditation. Parents took
leave of their children, children of their parents, friends
parted from friends, lovers from lovers. Tears flowed
on all sides. Profane mirth and ribald jests mingled
discordantly with pious oraisons and tearful farewells.
Others again were sullenly awaiting their doom with
crossed arms and heads drooping on their breasts,
keeping apart from the others, being too proud to pray,
and yet indifferent to the amusements of the more
light-hearted.</p>

<p>Well, days, weeks, passed by, I suppose, for I do not
recollect what time elapsed during my incarceration, as
I kept no count, being in a kind of mental stupor all
the time, nor could I bring myself to believe that the
scene before me was real, and not a dream. All the
events from the time of my arrest, flitted through my
mind like a vast phantasmagoria.</p>

<p>Since my imprisonment, I had been tried, found
guilty, and condemned to death. The day had been
fixed, and yet it weighed but lightly upon me, being
nothing more that what I had expected and prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
myself for. Each day brought new arrests, and each
day some of my companions were led forth to execution.
It is wonderfully consoling to find that others are
about to share a like fate as one's self. This I found by
experience, for, engrossed as I was, with my own
selfish thoughts, I still found time to be touched with
the misfortunes of others, and on several occasions I
offered consolation, and received consolation from many
of my fellow prisoners. In some instances I had
struck up quite a warm friendship with the inmates of
my cell, but alas! our intimacy lasted but long enough
for us to know, love, and esteem each other. No
sooner had I begun to feel for my fellow sufferer as a
friend and brother, than the following day he was
certain to be torn from me, and led off to execution.
One of these friendships formed in prison, especially
dwells upon me; perhaps because it was one of the
longest.</p>

<p>My friend was a young man of my own years, and
of noble family, as he said. He told me also his name,
but I have forgotten it. He was imprisoned because it
was thought he entertained aristocratic opinions, and
was a devout Catholic. He was in love, but the idol of
his affections belonged to an atheistical family. It
had been the dream of his ambition to eradicate the
heretical opinions she had imbibed and convert her
to the Catholic faith. He was looked upon with
suspicion by her family, who, disapproving of the match,
were instrumental in placing him in the Bastille. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
ventured to condole with him, though he needed not my
consolation, as his comfort was in his religion. Of all my
companions in prison, I found him the most resigned.</p>

<p>When I had learnt his tale, I told him mine, saying
that I was a poor <i>perruquier-barbier</i> who had left his
country for a while to complete his art studies, and who,
happening to fall in love with his employer's daughter,
had, through the jealousy and malice of a rival, who
had falsely accused him, found himself imprisoned in
the Bastille, and condemned to death. He was touched
with my tale as I had been with his, for our histories
had something in common. We were both in love, in
prison, and condemned to death. We wept together,
we embraced, we kissed (Frenchmen always kiss); and
though he was a gentleman of noble family, and I only
a lowly barber, yet, on the brink of the grave, all
distinctions are levelled, so we embraced, and called
ourselves brothers in adversity. How I prayed and
longed that our lives might be spared, that we might the
longer enjoy each other's friendship, or that we might
quit this world in each other's company! But fate
willed it otherwise. On the morrow, he whom I had
learnt to love as a brother was torn from me and led
to the scaffold. My life seemed now a blank. Whilst
my friend lived in his troubles, I forgot my own; now
that he was no more I began to realise all the horrors
of my situation.</p>

<p>At length the eve of my execution arrived. I tried
to give myself up wholly to pious meditation, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
throwing myself down in the corner of my cell, I
endeavoured to recall all my past life, to repent of my
sins, and pray for a speedy and peaceful end; but then
the guillotine rose up before me in all its terrors, and
bodily fear would usurp the place of holier thoughts.
The nearer the hour drew, the more vividly everything
painted itself to my mind's eye. I must leave Pauline
without a word of farewell. The heartless turnkey,
inured to scenes of death and misery, would witness me
depart to execution without a tear. Then the insolence
of the brutal guard, the gaping crowd, the scaffold, and
surly executioner, the cold steel close to my neck, one
terrible shock and then&mdash;then&mdash;eternity&mdash;a vast blank&mdash;an
unexpected world&mdash;doubt, suspense, <i>perhaps</i>, total
annihilation.</p>

<p>"Merciful God!" I exclaimed in agony, "is there
no hope? I ask not for length of days, but only time
to repent. Let me not be ushered into Thy awful
presence unprepared. Help me to my salvation, and
fit me for my end." Here I shut my eyes and prayed
long and fervently, after which I felt more resigned. I
heard the clock toll forth the hour of midnight, and most
of the inmates of my cell were fast asleep. I now felt
a chilly sensation creep over me, an indescribable awe,
as if in the presence of something more than mortal. I
opened my eyes and was aware of a vaporous form or
column of luminous ether standing beside me, which
gradually growing more distinct, shaped itself into the
bearing and lineaments of my father. My breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
forsook me. My eyeballs straining from their sockets,
fixed the cloudy image without my having the power to
remove them, and I was unable to utter a word.</p>

<p>Presently a low, though distant, voice (whether it
proceeded from the figure or not, I cannot say, for it
seemed to come from a distance and to sing through my
head) uttered these words: "My son, it has pleased
Heaven for once that the innocent shall be spared and
the wicked punished. Fear not, for I am sent to
protect you. Another has been provided to take your
place at the scaffold. In another minute he will be
here. When you hear the key turn in the lock and
see the door open wide, be ready to fly with me."</p>

<p>"Fly with you, father!" I mentally cried. To which
the spectre answered, "I will envelop you in my essence,
and being invisible myself to others, will make you likewise
invisible. Thus, as the new prisoner enters, we will
pass unseen by the turnkey through the open door, and
so on, past the guard, till we find ourselves outside.
Once past all danger, I will conduct you to the seashore,
where a vessel awaits you to carry you back to England."</p>

<p>Each word was uttered slowly and distinctly, and
whilst he was yet speaking I heard the key grate against
the lock, and the door of my prison being flung open,
a fresh prisoner entered, accompanied by the jailor.
What was my surprise when, by the light of the jailor's
lanthorn, I recognised my old rival, Jacques Millefleurs!</p>

<p>I had no time to speculate on the "how" or the
"wherefore" of his arrest, but in obedience to my father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
orders I passed fearlessly through the open door, which
was immediately closed after me. I passed the guards,
not without a certain tremor, yet no one appeared to see
me or impede my course. I hurried past the outer gate,
and quickening my pace, soon left the Bastille and its
terrors far behind me.</p>

<p>Morning at length dawned, and as I passed through
the streets I observed that nobody looked me in the
face, but rather looked through me into space, as if I
were air. I was thus aware that I was still invisible, so
entering a diligence, arrived in due time at Calais.</p>

<p>"This is the vessel," said the voice, in my ear.
"Embark&mdash;the wind is fair. Farewell," and I found myself
once more alone and visible, for sundry passers-by
stared at me in surprise, no doubt wondering how I had
made my appearance there all of a sudden, not having
been on the spot a moment ago.</p>

<p>I hastened to take my place on board, and having
set sail, arrived, after a good passage, at Dover. How the
dear old white cliffs and the grand old castle seemed to
welcome me back to my native land! How thankful I
felt for my recent miraculous preservation! How joyfully
I leapt ashore, and with what buoyancy I trod my
native land again! It was as if I had never breathed
the air of liberty till now.</p>

<p>Once more in the land of the free, after a hearty
meal, I took the stage, and travelled until I reached my
native village; and here I am, gentlemen.</p>

<hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>"Upon my word, Mr. Suds," broke in Dr. Bleedem
as the barber concluded his story, "if you have many
more tales of that sort you'll soon rival the members of
the club. What do you say, Mr. Oldstone. Was not
that story worthy of a member?"</p>

<p>Mr. Oldstone could not go so far as to admit that
any one member of the club had ever been equalled in
story telling by a barber, and that, too, a Frenchified
barber, but he condescended to give a complacent
look of approval at the young man without directly
answering the question put to him, and then addressing
him said, as he pulled out his watch, "I don't know if
you are aware of it, Mr. Suds, but the absorbing interest
that you have forced us to take in your narrative has
made us quite forget church time, and it now wants
but a quarter to one o'clock."</p>

<p>"You don't say so," cried several voices at once.
"Sure enough," said another, "here are all the people
coming out of church."</p>

<p>"What!" cried our late story teller, in alarm,
"have I really, through my talk, prevented your honours
from exhibiting your chins at divine service, as a
sample of my art? This is indeed a sin my soul must
answer."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said Mr. Oldstone, "time past
cannot be recalled, all we can do is, to try to make up
for it by going to church this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Stop! stop! Mr. Suds, whither away so fast," he
cried, as he saw the young man making towards the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
with his tackle in his hand. "You have not told us what
became of Pauline. You finished your story rather too
abruptly; it requires a sequel. Come, let's hear it."</p>

<p>The youth returned, after closing the door, and
resting the tips of his fingers against the back of a chair,
proceeded gravely thus: "Little more remains to be
told, gentlemen. I heard from Pauline not long since.
Her letter runs as nearly as I can recollect in these
words:</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Suds, I write to you for the first and
last time. Perhaps I should not have written to you at
all. If I have erred from maiden modesty in so doing,
I hope you will excuse me. I really could not let so
great a friend pass from me without a word. I heard of
your escape by chance, and you may imagine my
extreme delight and thankfulness at the joyful news,
though I never could learn in what manner you effected
it. Enough for me that you are safe in your own free
country, far from the broils of civil discord and intestine
misery.</p>

<p>"Alas! my friend, if I may be allowed to call you by
that name, I have suffered much since we parted; so
much, indeed, that were you to see me now, you would
not know me again for the gay capricious Pauline of
former times, whose eyes and complexion you were
once wont to praise. Forgive me, my friend, forgive
me, Mr. Suds, if I have already said too much, and bear
with me still, while I yet disburden my heart of more.
The words tremble on my pen, my hand refuses to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
write what my heart dictates, for fear of incurring
your displeasure and contempt, rather than brook
which I would that my hand would paralyse, that I
might never touch pen more; that my lips were sealed
that I might never more express the feelings that rise
and crave for utterance, ay that my heart itself would
cease to beat. I can no longer restrain my pen. My
eyes fill with tears as I write. Pardon my temerity. I
feel I must speak or die.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Suds, did you ever imagine that from the
very first moment that you introduced yourself at my
father's shop that my heart was no longer my own?
Did you know that the attentions of the odious Jacques
Millefleurs which my vanity only induced me to
encourage, from that time became loathsome to me,
and my heart told me too truly the reason why?</p>

<p>"Oh! my dearest friend, if you knew how hard it has
been to me to persist in dissimulation for so long, to
hide from my father and from Millefleurs that which
was passing in my bosom!</p>

<p>"Oh! if you knew the shock I received when I
witnessed your arrest and the deadly hatred that I bore
towards Jacques Millefleurs for being the cause, oh,
then my love! then, I say, you would pardon me all,
ay, even the hideous crime I perpetrated for your sake.
Know then, my loved one, that it was I&mdash;I,&mdash;your
Pauline, who accused Jacques to the government for
conspiring against it, even as he had falsely accused you,
and caused him to be arrested and condemned! Know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
you that whilst your bark was peacefully crossing the
channel that Jacques Millefleurs was taking your place
at the scaffold? You are avenged, and through me,
though I know your noble nature must recoil at such
retaliation. Enough, he is judged; peace be to his soul.</p>

<p>"But, alas, evil though he may have been, will his
crimes help to wash out one iota of the stain of my
guilt? Shall I ever feel the stings of remorse less
keenly because I committed the rash and mean act
in the very torrent of passion?</p>

<p>"Oh! my friend, I feel I have merited your
contempt and scorn for having given way thus to the
promptings of my evil nature. I fancy I see you start
and shrink back whilst reading these lines, and
saying to yourself, 'Can Pauline have been guilty of
so black a crime?' No wonder you shrink back in
horror and loathing; yet, loathe me as you will, you
cannot loathe me as much as I loathe myself. I thought
revenge would be sweet, but now the bitterness of
remorse has filled my heart. The remembrance of my
crime is intolerable to me; it haunts me night and day.
I feel that nothing short of the sacrifice of my whole life
can do aught towards atoning for so black a deed.</p>

<p>"Yes, my friend, many and bitter have been the
tears of remorse that I have shed, very bitter the
reproaches I have launched against myself. But to what
purpose all this? What should your young and innocent
soul know of the torments I bear within? Enough, my
resolution is fixed never to be changed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>"Start not, friend, when I tell you that I have
renounced the world and its vanities, and intend to retire
into a convent, there to atone by a lifetime of fasting and
prayer for the fell crime that harrows my soul. I was
once vain enough to dream of becoming your bride, but
now I am called upon to be the bride of Heaven.
Shortly after you receive this I shall have taken the veil.
Think no more of one unworthy to find a place in your
thoughts. Forgive me if you can. Farewell, yours,
Pauline."</p>

<p>"These, gentlemen, are the words of her letter, as
well as I can recollect. The letter bears no date or
address, but it bore the post-mark, 'Brussels.' As the
letter did not appear to crave an answer, I wrote none
and thus the matter dropped."</p>

<p>"Poor girl!" broke in Parnassus, with a sigh; "her
crime was great, no doubt; but done in the very heat of
passion; and then, her repentance is extremely touching."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Blackdeed, "she winds up in a
manner quite dramatic."</p>

<p>The members of the club then expressed, severally,
their approbation of the barber's narrative, upon which
the young man bowed and scraped, and hoped he should
be able to satisfy the honourable members as well on a
future occasion, if his services should be required, and
then quitted the inn. In the afternoon our members
attended divine service, to a man; and, after a stroll
in the wood, returned home in the evening, which they
spent in their usual jovial manner.</p>
